MEGA Training (12-Week Program)

Now, it’s time to talk about MEGA training, or minimum effort growth acceleration.

This is a strategy I developed to maximize muscle growth. It's pretty simple. We'll be adding a couple bonus exercises every workout that are designed to get in more volume. MEGA training increases sarcoplasmic hypertrophy towards your key muscle groups. The icing on the cake, sarcoplasmic hypertrophy is muscle growth due to more fluid in the muscle tissue. It’s best achieved with higher reps and shorter rest periods.

I don’t recommend MEGA training year-round. I find strength and density work to be the best at producing long-term strength and muscle gains. MEGA training creates faster muscle growth in bursts. If you do it too long, it will stop working effectively, as your body will get used to the higher volume. Strength gains can start to slow down.

My favorite strategy is to do a 2:1 ratio of strength and density and MEGA training. This, of course, is the case with the two-day split. The two-day split is pretty damn brutal with MEGA training, since you’re going to be doing pretty big workouts with a high degree of intensity.

I recommend doing about six months of strength and density, followed by three months of MEGA training. That would make up the first round. If you want to repeat this strategy, simply do four months of strength and density, followed by two months of MEGA training. This would keep your training routine more fun and engaging. The longer you’ve been training, the more frequently you want to change things up.

MEGA Training Notes

Be careful not to push every set to failure with MEGA training. You'll quickly burn out. It’s best to keep a rep in the tank on your sets. If you can get nine reps, stop at eight. Avoid grinding out your sets. If you have to kill yourself to get another rep, don’t go for it. By keeping a rep in the tank, you'll maintain greater strength and performance throughout the entire workout, which allows for better muscle gains.

I also recommend utilizing Kinobody's Superhero Stack during this program. The superhero stack includes Kino Octane (pre workout), Kino Aminos (branched-chain amino acids) and Kino Gains (creatine and L-carnitine). Supplementing your diet with these nutrients will produce the absolute best results possible.

Chapter 11
Specialization Routines
For rapid muscle growth, I recommend using specialization routines. This is how you can force muscle growth at a quicker rate. You simply can’t increase volume on all of your muscle groups. Doing so would equal overtraining and strength regression.

Therefore, the solution is to pick one muscle group on each workout day and add more volume to it.

(Note: Stick with the same specialization workouts for six weeks before changing.)

Chest Specialization


Workout A: Chest, Shoulders, Triceps

Incline Bench Press: 5 sets x 5, 6, 8, 8, 8 reps (reverse pyramid training)
Flat Bench Press: 3 sets x 6, 8, 10 reps (reverse pyramid training)
Lateral Raises: 3 sets x 8-12 reps
Skull Crushers: 3 sets x 6-10 reps

Notes on the Workout


For this workout, you'll be adding two additional sets to incline bench press. This extra volume will speed up muscle growth. Use the same weight for the last three sets. If you're unable to get the full eight reps, that’s fine - do what you can.

In addition, you'll be performing flat bench press for your second exercise. This is a great overall mass builder to the chest, especially in conjunction with incline bench as well. For variance, do incline with the barbell and flat bench with dumbbells.


Shoulder Specialization

Workout A: Chest, Shoulders, Triceps


Standing Shoulder Press: 5 sets x 5, 6, 8, 8, 8 (reverse pyramid training)
Weighted Dips or Close-Grip Bench: 3 sets x 5, 6, 8 (reverse pyramid training)
Lateral Raises: 3 sets x 8-12 reps
Skull Crushers: 3 sets x 8-12 reps

Notes on the Workout


For this workout, you'll be adding two additional sets to standing shoulder press. For standing press, use the same weight for the last three sets.


Triceps Specialization

Workout A: Chest, Shoulders, Triceps


Incline Bench Press: 3 sets x 5, 6, 8 (reverse pyramid training)
Weighted Dips or Close-Grip Bench: 3 sets x 6, 8, 10 reps (reverse pyramid training)
Lateral Raises: 3 sets x 8-12 reps
Skull Crushers: 3 sets x 6-10 reps
Rope Extensions: 2 sets x 10-12 reps



Notes on the Workout

For this workout, you'll add an extra triceps exercise to the end of the workout. Keep the rest between 60-90 seconds on rope extensions.

Back Specialization

Workout B: Back, Biceps, Traps, Legs

Weighted Pullups: 5 sets x 5, 6, 8, 8, 8 (reverse pyramid training)
Hang Cleans or Sumo Deadlifts: 3 sets x 5, 6, 8 (reverse pyramid training)
Bent-Over Flyes: 3 sets x 8-12 reps
Barbell Curls: 3 sets x 6-10 reps

Notes on the Workout


For this workout, you'll perform pullups instead of chinups.

In addition, you will be performing five sets total. If you're unable to perform at least five reps on the last three sets, you can switch over to LAT pulldown for the last few sets.

Biceps Specialization

Workout B: Back, Biceps, Traps, Legs


Weighted Close-Grip Chinups: 3 sets x 5, 6, 8 (reverse pyramid training)
Barbell Curls: 3 sets x 6-10 reps
Incline Dumbbell Curls: 2 sets x 8-12 reps
Bent-Over Flyes: 3 sets x 8-12 reps
Pistols + Calf Raises: 3 sets x 3-5 reps + 10-12 reps
Notes on the Workout


For this workout, you'll add an extra biceps exercise to the end of the workout. Keep the rest between 60-90 seconds on incline dumbbell curls.


Legs Specialization

Workout B: Back, Biceps, Traps, Legs


Squats: 3 sets x 5, 6, 8 (reverse pyramid training)
Calf Raises: 3 sets x 8-12 reps
Weighted Chinups: 3 sets x 5, 6, 8 (reverse pyramid training)
Bent-Over Flyes: 3 sets x 8-12 reps
Barbell Curls: 3 sets x 6-10 reps

Notes on the Workout


For this workout, you'll be performing squats. The squat is so powerful at building leg mass that most people don’t need to use this exercise for very long.

If you have slim legs this is a good routine to use. If you don’t want to get bigger legs, then I would recommend avoiding this routine.

You should be adding 5 pounds to the bar every squat workout. This is because squats progress at a faster rate than upper body movements.

If you do not wish to perform the barbell back squat, you can perform the pistol squat instead. Perform three sets of the pistol squat, slow and controlled. If possible, use weight on your first two sets.

For example:

Set 1: 40 pounds x 5 reps (or Set 1: 20 pounds x 5 reps)
Set 2: 20 pounds x 6 reps (or Set 2: Bodyweight x 6 reps)
Set 3: Bodyweight x 8 reps (or Set 3: Bodyweight x 6 reps)

Chapter 12
Greek God 2.0 Three-Day Split
The final protocol in the Greek God Program 2.0 is the three-day split. Instead of doing all your training over the course of two workouts (Workout A and Workout B), we'll be doing it over the course of three workouts (Workout A, Workout B and Workout C). This allows for more exercise selection and more focus on specific muscle groups.

Doing the two-day split for several years, it eventually becomes pretty damn brutal, taxing your body that often. You won’t be able to continue making rapid rates of strength gains. So, it makes sense to switch to a three-day split. This will mean a slightly slower rate of strength gain, but you’ll be able to hit your key muscle groups with more volume per session. This can help you keep gaining muscle at a solid rate as a more advanced lifter.

Furthermore, after doing the three-day split for three months, you can go back to the two-day split for two to three months. Mixing things up every few months allows your body to keep progressing. Of course, if you were to do the two-day split year round, you'd eventually burn out.

Another advantage of the three-day split is it allows you to work on your shoulder press completely fresh. This will help you hit more shoulder press personal records and build greater overall shoulder size and development.

Finally, for the three-day split, we'll be taking your physique to the next level with some neck and traps training. Filling out your neck and traps will make you look stronger, more muscular and even more masculine. In fact, a thick neck is a sign of a more masculine man. It’s incredible how adding a little neck and trap thickness can make you look more more alpha and attractive. I’ve noticed a big difference, adding 1-1.5 inches to my neck thickness. (Of course, you don't want to overdo neck development; that's why we implement the ideal amount of training.)

All of this to say, once you start to plateau or feel the slog of two-day splits, it's time to experience the benefits of the three-day split.

The Beauty of the Three Day Split
The three-day split is incredibly powerful. In fact, most of your key muscle groups will be getting hit hard two times per week. You're hitting your chest hard on Friday. That said, your chest will be hit indirectly on Monday as well. The same goes for shoulders. Your shoulders will be hit very hard on Monday. Then on Friday, you get indirect shoulder work from incline press, bench press/dips and rear deltoid lifts. Your triceps will be getting hit hard two days a week (directly from extensions and indirectly from presses). The same goes for biceps.

The only muscle groups that will be hit only once per week are back and legs. However, from my experience this works perfectly as, typically, these muscle groups can grow very quickly. The back and legs are big muscle groups and can easily become overdeveloped. The harder muscle groups to build are the shoulders, arms and upper chest.

This three-day split is the best protocol to optimize your shoulder, upper chest and arm development while developing the perfect amount of back and leg size for the ultimate Greek God Physique.

Nutrition Plan for Building Muscle and Avoiding Fat Gain

Nutrition for building muscle is actually very simple: Eat plenty of food and include lots of protein and carbs.

If you follow this protocol and workout, you'll definitely build muscle. However, when the goal is to build muscle and keep fat gain to an absolute minimum, diet and nutrition become much more complicated.

Your body can only use so many surplus calories for muscle growth and storage. Eventually, any additional calories will be stored as fat.

In order to ensure you build muscle without gaining fat you need to be diligent in tracking your food intake. Eat too few calories and muscle growth will not occur at a meaningful rate. Eat too many calories and unpleasant fat gain will occur.

We need to find the amount of weekly surplus calories you can handle before fat gain occurs. For most people, this is around 2,000 surplus calories per week. This works out to be an extra 285 calories per day.

Most guys trying to build muscle aim to eat 500 calories over maintenance per day. Those extra 215 calories tend to get stored as fat. Instead of eating 285 extra calories each and every day, it’s better to place more calories on lifting days and less calories on rest days. This will lead to slightly better muscle gains since you'll be providing extra calories on days where your body is primed for muscle growth.

Chapter 14
Determining Maintenance Level Calories
Without knowing your maintenance intake of calories, this protocol won't be very helpful.

Fortunately, determining your maintenance calorie intake is rather simple. Assuming 60 minutes of physical activity per day, most people burn 15 calories per pound of bodyweight.

Now, obviously, this is just an estimate. It's unlikely that these numbers will be exact. However, there's a very strong chance that you'll be within shooting distance of the number calculated.

If you're gaining weight too quickly, then you can lower your maintenance level calories by 10 percent. If you're not gaining weight or gaining weight too slowly, then you can increase your maintenance level calories by 10 percent.

Eventually, you'll be able to zone in on your approximate maintenance level calorie intake.

Chapter 15
The Lean Bulk Nutrition Protocol
​The Protocol
​Rest Days (4 times per week): +100 calories over maintenance
Lifting Days (3 times per week): +500 calories over maintenance
Weekly calorie surplus = 1900 calories

Modification
If you tend to gain fat easily, then you can reduce calories slightly on rest days.

Instead of eating +100 calories on rest days you could eat -100 calories on rest days.

Rest Days (4 times per week): -100 calories under maintenance
Lifting Days (3 times per week): +500 calories over maintenance
Weekly calorie surplus = 1100 calories

Recomposition Protocol
If you want to focus on building muscle and losing fat at a slow rate, then it’s better to use a recomposition protocol. This is where you eat at at a calorie surplus on training days to encourage muscle growth and at a calorie deficit on rest days to encourage fat loss.

At the end of the week, you'll have eaten very close to maintenance but it's likely you'll have improved your overall body composition (more muscle and less fat).

Rest Days (4 times per week): -300 calories under maintenance
Lifting Days (3 times per week): +400 calories over maintenance
Weekly calorie surplus = 0

It’s best to use a modest calorie surplus/deficit on lifting/rest days. Go too low in calories on rest days, and muscle recovery and growth will be compromised. As well, going too high in calories on training days will inevitably lead to fat spillover. Instead of building a little muscle on training days and losing a little fat on rest day you will be gaining muscle and fat on training days and losing muscle and fat on rest days.

Obviously, big calorie swings between lifting and rest days aren’t optimal. Therefore, using a 300-400 calorie surplus/deficit is your best option.

Lean Bulk Protocol for 160-pound Person:

Maintenance Level Calories: 160 x 15 = 2400 calories
Rest Days (4 times per week): 2500 calories (+100)
Lifting Days (3 times per week): 2900 calories (+500)
Weekly calorie surplus = 1900

Recomposition Protocol Using This Example:

Rest Days (4 times per week): 2100 calories (-300)
Lifting Days (3 times per week): 2800 calories (+400)
Weekly Calorie Surplus = 0 

Chapter 16
Determining Protein, Fat and Carb Intake
Of secondary importance to calorie intake is the makeup of those calories.

The first thing that you must do is to ensure you are consuming adequate dietary protein. Since protein is essential for muscle growth, this is the number one priority in regards to macronutrient intake. Before even worrying about how much fat and carbs to eat, you need to first determine your protein needs.

Most research indicates that the maximum amount of protein needed to support muscle growth is 1.8 grams per kg (or 0.8 grams per pound) of bodyweight, but I feel consuming slightly more protein than this is beneficial. Since we need to be careful not to overeat and cause fat gain, it makes sense to eat lots of protein to stay full and satisfied. For this reason, I recommend eating one gram of protein per pound of goal bodyweight. As long as you include high protein foods in your meals, it'll be relatively easy to reach this amount. If you have trouble eating this much protein, you're welcome to include protein shakes into your diet.

If you are 160 pounds and your goal is to be 175 pounds, then aim for 175 grams of protein per day. Don’t set your protein intake more than 15 over your current weight in pounds. So if you’re 160 pounds and your goal weight is 180 pounds, then set your protein intake at a maximum of 175 grams per day. When you are within 15 pounds of your goal weight, then you can adjust your protein intake up to 180 grams.

The next macronutrient to set is fat intake. Fat should make up 20-30% of total calories. Going too low in fat will leave you hungry between meals and will make your meals bland. Plus, low-fat diets may negatively impact testosterone levels. Use 25 percent of total calories as the default for fat intake.

If you prefer to include more fat in exchange for carbs, you can adjust this number up to 30 percent. If you prefer less fat and more carbs you can adjust this number down to 20 percent.

A fat intake of between 20-30 percent of total calories will leave the largest percentage of your calories to come from carbohydrates. This is an ideal scenario for building muscle. A high intake of carbohydrates will ensure that you maintain full glycogen stores in your muscles. Your body is more efficient at building muscle and being in an anabolic state when your glycogen stores are full or near full. In addition, carbs are the most efficient energy source and sufficient carbs will ensure optimal training performance.

The better and more intense your workouts are, the more muscle growth you will promote.

To calculate fat intake: Multiply calories per day by 0.25 (25 percent) and then divide that number by 9 to get grams of fat per day.
To calculate carb intake: Add together fat calories and protein calories. Subtract this number from total calories per day. This will provide you with the number of calories to consume from carbs per day. Divide this number by 4 to get carbs per day in grams.

Chapter 17
Meal Frequency and Distribution
Assuming you are hitting the appropriate amount of calories and macronutrients, meal frequency isn’t awfully important. Whether you eat two meals or six meals won’t make an ounce of difference. For that reason, I recommend sticking to the meal pattern that you enjoy the most.

For most people, having to eat five or more meals per day is a pain in the ass. Most people I find do best on two to four meals per day. The biggest meals should come in the evening and after training. This maximizes fat burning during the day and amplifies glycogen storage in the muscles from training. As well, big meals early in the day tend to cause tiredness. Lastly, this eating pattern tends to be the most enjoyable and satisfying.

My recommended plan is to skip breakfast, eat a moderate sized lunch, train in the afternoon, have a big dinner with plenty of carbs post-workout and then another big meal 1-2 hours before going to bed.

If you train in the evening, then it would be better to eat a moderate sized lunch, another moderate sized meal 2-3 hours before training and a big dinner post-workout.

If you train earlier in the day, then it’s best to take 10 grams of BCAAs before training, have a normal sized lunch, a big dinner and another meal 3-4 hours later (2 hours before going to bed).

Example Meal Schedule

Wake up at 8 a.m.
8 a.m. to Meal 1: Coffee and sparkling water (I prefer Fasting Fuel -- learn more here)
2 p.m.: Meal 1 (protein salad or 2 percent Greek yogurt and almonds)
5 p.m.: Workout
6:30 p.m.: Meal 2 (animal protein and rice, potatoes or yams)
10 p.m.: Meal 3 (animal protein and rice, potatoes or yams)
Sample Meal Plan 1:

Meal 1:

Plain Greek yogurt or cottage cheese
Handful of almonds
Serving of fruit
Meals 2 and 3:

Chicken breast
Brown rice cooked in 1-2 tablespoons of coconut oil
Veggies and spinach salad
Sample Meal Plan 2:

Meal 1:

Salad loaded with grilled chicken breast, sliced tomatoes, cucumbers, shredded cheese and avocado
Serving of fruit
Meals 2 and 3:

Beef (flank steak, 90 percent lean ground beef, or roast beef)
Potatoes or sweet potatoes
Butter (for taste)
Veggies and spinach salad
What About Breakfast?
I recommend skipping breakfast.

I can already hear the comments: “Skip breakfast? Are you crazy?”

There's really no good reason to eat breakfast. By pushing your first meal later into the day, you force your body to burn fat for fuel, elevate growth hormone and increase insulin sensitivity in the muscles. This creates the perfect storm for building muscle and burning fat.

As long as you limit the daily fast to 16-18 hours, there will be no muscle catabolism during the fast.

When you do eat after an extended fast, the anabolic effects of that meal will be greater. This is due to improvements in your insulin sensitivity. It leads to greater nutrition partitioning in your muscles stores.

I have found that, by skipping breakfast, I've had a much easier time building muscle while maintaining leanness. That said, it's essential that you provide your body with the right amount of nutrition during the feasting window. If you're incapable getting in the appropriate amount of calories in 2-3 large meals, then fasting is probably not for you.

If you wish to workout before your first meal, then I recommend taking 10 grams of BCAAs before training. Pre-workout protein is highly beneficial at increasing protein synthesis and preventing protein breakdown. 

Chapter 18
Tracking Progress
One of the main reasons why people fail to follow through on their workout program and nutrition plan is because of a lack of accountability. They make it extremely easy for themselves to miss workouts, half-ass it in the gym and not follow their diet regimen.

This is simply unacceptable!

By purchasing this program, you made the decision right then and there that you no longer wanted to settle for a mediocre body. You wanted to rise above and beyond and achieve an awe-striking physique. I’m talking about the level of physical development which brings with it enormous amounts of self-respect and confidence.

I want you to commit to following this workout program with absolute consistency and dedication. That you will do whatever it takes to hit the gym three times per week with extraordinary effort and drive. No matter what, you will not sabotage your efforts by rationalizing skipping the gym or screwing up your diet.

The reason most people have so much difficulty following through on a workout plan is because they make up excuses for why they can’t hit the gym. They lie to themselves that it will just be this one time and that the following weeks will be perfect. The truth is that if you are going to skip a workout now then you will do so again in the future. You need to hold yourself accountable and do whatever it takes to drag yourself to the gym.

I have never met anyone in my life that couldn’t find one hour to work out three times per week. If something comes up, shift things around and make it work. There's simply no excuse for not being able to work out three times per week. End of story.

Making This Plan Work

To really maximize your results on this program, it's essential that you track your strength and physique progress. By doing so, your results will improve dramatically. When you're tracking your progress, missing a workout or just going through the motions in the gym has real, substantial consequences. Tracking progress is the most effective way to keep yourself disciplined and accountable for your actions.




Progress Tracking 1: Lifts


Each workout, you should be recording and tracking your main lifts. Your main core lifts are incline bench press, weighted chinups, standing shoulder press, and your current leg exercise. If you follow the progression scheme correctly, you'll be adding 10-15 pounds per month to each of these lifts.

Beginners will alternate adding 5 pounds to their second and third set or their first set each workout. Advanced lifters will add 5 pounds to only one of their three sets per workouts.

If you’re only capable of doing chinups for 5 reps with 15 pounds, then you could get up to 75-105 pounds for 5 reps in 6 months. If you are incline bench pressing 135 pounds for 5 reps, then in 6 months you could get up to 195-225 pounds. These are crazy leaps in strength and muscle gain! But it only works if you track your progress.

Combine this with a low body fat and you will be dropping jaws.


Progress Tracking 2: Weight and Waist Measurement


Each week, you should be weighing yourself and measuring your waist circumference around your belly button with a normal, relaxed posture (no sucking in or flexing). If you're slowly gaining weight - about half a pound per week - and your waist is staying the same, then you know you're building pure muscle. This is great! If you're in a recomposition and staying around the same weight but your waist is becoming smaller, then you know you're gaining muscle and losing fat.

On the other hand, if your waist measurement is going up, you know you're overdoing it with your calorie intake. You would want to cut the calories back to eliminate fat gain.

Make sure to weigh yourself the same day each week. Weigh yourself and measure your waist first thing in the morning (after using the bathroom if required). This will provide the greatest accuracy.


Progress Tracking 3: Muscle Measurements


Each month I recommend taking a few additional measurements to get the full picture. This will give you an idea of how exactly your body is changing. I recommend measuring the chest with relaxed posture at mid-chest level, no flexing in or sticking out the chest.

I also recommend measuring your arms. The best way to measure the arms is by flexing them and measuring around the widest point, usually right in the middle of the biceps.

Take this measurement first thing in the morning. If you measure after a workout, you'll notice a slightly bigger reading. This is only temporary so it doesn’t count.


Progress Tracking 4: Photos

A picture says a thousand words! A picture can say so much more than a number. For that reason, it's wise to take regular monthly pictures to track progress. I recommend taking pictures in the morning and in the same lighting conditions each time.

Here are the pictures I recommend taking:

Front pose relaxed, flexed abs and double biceps pose
Back pose relaxed and double biceps pose
Side pose flexed triceps and side pose flexed biceps

Kinobody Fitness Standards
I'm always motivated when I have certain targets to reach, whether it's 20 consecutive chinups, 8 percent body fat or a 300-pound bench press. Back in the day, I loved fitness books that provided elite standards to strive for.

Now, I'm going to provide you with the Kinobody fitness standards for achieving the strong and sexy Greek God physique.

I am using three different levels of development: good, great and godlike.

“Good” is someone who is in above average shape.
“Great” is someone who is in top shape.
“Godlike” is someone who is, quite frankly, a god; someone in such spectacular shape that you can’t possible fathom that they are in fact merely human.
Strength Standards

Incline Bench Press


Good: 1x bodyweight for 5 reps
Great: 1.2x bodyweight for 5 reps

The Leg-Focused Strength and Density Bonus Routine
If you want to get very strong on your deadlift, I've included the heavy deadlift option.

You see, the standard Greek God Program 2.0 includes Bulgarian split squats and Romanian deadlifts (Phase One), as well as box squats and single-leg Romanian deadlifts (Phase Two). This is great -- and definitely enough -- for developing your lower body.

However, if you want to really maximize your deadlift strength, you'll want to perform the heavy deadlift option. Now, I recommend being careful with going very heavy on deadlifts. This is where I’ve seen injuries happen. Even with the heavy deadlift option, I recommend not pushing beyond 90 percent of your maximum. 

The reason is simple: Pushing too close to failure on deadlifts can be very risky. This is where you'll be grinding reps out and you may put your lower back in a vulnerable position. Plus, going too intense on your heavy deadlifts can interfere with your central nervous system recovery, which is NOT what we want.

The benefit of keeping your heavy set at about 90 percent intensity is that it allows you to execute the set with better form and a faster cadence (a.k.a. more explosive). This means it will better carry over to sports, or to your sprinting and jumping. 

Enter the Deadlift 
Now, the deadlift can be a great overall strength movement. The deadlift develops your hamstrings, glutes, low back, mid back, traps and forearms to a large degree. 

I prefer to do the sumo deadlift, which I feel does a greater job at building your legs and ensuring your back maintains proper positioning (i.e., no rounding). The sumo deadlift is performed by taking a wider stance. Your feet should actually be outside of your hands. 

In fact, one of the top sprint coaches in the world, Barry Ross, has found the sumo deadlift to do an amazing job at carrying over to sprinting; therefore, if you want to improve your running, I suggest getting strong on your sumo deadlift.

The Heavy Deadlift Bonus Routine 
So for the heavy deadlift option, you'll replace the leg exercises from the standard Workout B with the following routine: 

Heavy Deadlift Phase One 
Sumo Deadlifts: 5 sets x 5 reps (Kino rep training)
Bulgarian Split Squats: 3 sets x 6-8 reps (Kino rep training)
Notes
I recommend performing the deadlifts a'la Kino rep training for five reps per set. This is where you start light and perform five reps. For each set, increase the weight. You want to increase the weight accordingly so that your last set is close to your five-rep max. Rest two to three minutes between sets. 

For example, let's say you can deadlift 300 pounds for five reps. Here’s how it would look:

Set 1: 135 pounds x 5 reps
Set 2: 185 pounds x 5 reps
Set 3: 225 pounds x 5 reps
Set 4: 275 pounds x 5 reps
Set 5: 300 pounds x 5 reps
As for the next week, you'd increase the weight on all sets by roughly 5 pounds: 

Set 1: 140 pounds x 5 reps
Set 2: 190 pounds x 5 reps
Set 3: 230 pounds x 5 reps
Set 4: 280 pounds x 5 reps
Set 5: 305 pounds x 5 reps
You would keep increasing by 5 pounds every workout until you plateau. This would be the perfect time to go back to the lighter deadlift option in the original Greek God training schedule (Bulgarian split squats and Romanian deadlifts or front squats and single-leg Romanian deadlifts).

For Bulgarian split squats, increase the weight on all three sets when you can do eight reps on each set. 

Heavy Deadlift Phase Two
Sumo Deadlifts: 5 sets x 5 reps (Kino rep training)
Front Squats: 3 sets x 6-8 reps (Kino rep training)
Notes
For phase two of the heavy deadlift, you'll be switching the secondary exercise to barbell front squats. The front squat is a great movement to develop your leg strength with more focus on your quads. It also does an amazing job building a rock-solid core. 

It's the same as phase one for the sumo deadlift. For front squats, you'll start light and increase the weight on all three sets. When you can do the top end of the rep range on all three sets, increase the weight for each set come next workout. 

Example:

Set 1: 135 pounds x 8 reps
Set 2: 165 pounds x 8 reps
Set 3: 195 pounds x 8 reps
Next workout:

Set 1: 140 pounds x 6 reps
Set 2: 170 pounds x 6 reps
Set 3: 200 pounds x 6 reps
(Then you would stay at that weight until you get eight reps on all three sets). 

May your legs grow as big as tree trunks and may your speed get as fast as the Flash!

The Greek God Missing Link: Neck and Traps 
If you want to look like a Greek God, there’s one more thing we need to do. You can build an amazing physique, complete with an incredible upper chest, developed shoulders and muscular legs. That said, that doesn’t absolutely guarantee that you'll look your absolute best. 

In many cases, there can be something missing. I’ve noticed this myself. I’ve seen really muscular guys and thought something was off...

Sometimes it’s because their upper chest or shoulders are lacking. But sometimes they have amazing shoulder and upper chest development and yet something is still missing.

Something is making them look less powerful and less masculine and less alpha. What is it? When you look at someone, you’re looking at the total package...and after a while, you'll notice two areas that can make them appear far more powerful and masculine:

Enter Neck and Traps Training


You can have all the muscle in the world, but if your neck and traps are lacking, it’s going to throw off your whole physique. You’re going to look noticeably smaller. What’s more, if you gain muscle, but your neck and traps stay roughly the same size, it’s going to make you look smaller. 

Your neck can actually be a force multiplier. If you add a little size to your neck -- so that it’s thicker -- your face looks more masculine and attractive. Your overall physique looks bigger and more powerful. It makes a huge difference. 

You can have a muscular upper body, but if you're wearing a shirt or jacket, a skinny neck can make you look so much smaller. 

For instance, here’s Jeff Nippard, a fitness YouTube celebrity. He used to have a slim neck. Notice how he looks so much better with a thick neck. In fact, the skinny neck had a negative effect on his physique and even his facial attractiveness. 



What About the Traps? 
The same holds true with trap development. If your traps are too small, it’s going to throw things off. You'll look smaller and less jacked. There will also be something missing between your body and your face. 

For example, this guy has a very muscular physique, but he has a relatively small neck and minimal trap development. It naturally makes him look less powerful and dominant. 



If he were to wear a button down shirt, his small neck and traps would make him seem much less jacked and powerful. Many people may not even be able to tell he works out! That's why training your neck and traps specifically is so crucial; it gives you the size in underdeveloped areas to complete your Greek God physique.

The Key to Neck and Traps Training
Now of course, you can overdevelop your neck and traps. And that’s also far from ideal. The key is balance. The key is to add the perfect amount of size to your neck and traps without going overboard.

A lot of Hollywood movie stars that play superheroes naturally have the perfect neck and trap size. In fact, Chris Hemsworth is a great example of this and that’s why he looks so damn good on screen. 

Thankfully, the neck and traps have a large degree of androgen receptors. This means that people that naturally have higher testosterone levels will naturally have a bigger neck and traps. This is an indicator that well-developed neck and traps portray a more powerful and masculine image. 

Here’s Brad Pitt in Fight Club. Notice how he has a well-developed neck? Plus, you can see how his traps pop nicely and make him look bigger overall. Brad Pitt was only about 155-160 pounds in "Fight Club." And yet, he looks much thicker than that. That's the power of the neck and traps, my friend.



How to Supercharge Your Physique with Neck and Traps 
Now make no mistake, it’s not hard at all to add the perfect size to your neck and traps. In fact, we actually need to be careful not to overdo it. 

Some movements in the original program will actually strengthen and develop your neck and traps. For example, overhead presses and pullups will build your traps to a decent level. Lateral raises have been shown to activate the neck to a fairly large degree. So all we're doing is throwing in a little more direct work to the neck and traps to add icing to the cake. 

I recommend performing this routine once per week at the end of one of your workouts. For example, every Friday at the end of your workout would be an ideal place to add this.

The Greek God Neck and Traps Routine (Once Per Week)
Leaning One-Arm Dumbbell Shrugs: 4 sets x 10-15 reps (Kino rep training) 
Reverse Neck Curls: 3 sets x 20-30 reps (Kino rep training)
Neck Curls: 3 sets x 20-30 reps (Kino rep training) 
Workout Notes 
The workout begins with leaning one-arm dumbbell shrugs. Alternatively, you can do cable shrugs. The key, of course, is to not just lift your shoulder straight up. Instead, lift your shoulder up and towards your ear. This puts the focus on your traps, maximizing activation.

I recommend starting with a lighter weight and performing your first set for 15 reps. Rest one to two minutes and increase the weight to perform another set for 15 reps. Rest and increase the weight to perform your third set for 15 reps. Finally, rest and perform your fourth set with a very challenging weight that you can perform for 10-15 reps. At this point, your traps should be activated like crazy.

For example:

Set 1: 60 pounds x 15 reps
Set 2: 70 pounds x 15 reps
Set 3: 80 pounds x 15 reps
Set 4: 90 pounds x 10 reps
Next, we get into reverse neck curls. I recommend lying on a bench, face down, with your head off of the bench. Start with a light weight. A 5- or 10-pound plate is perfect. With the weight on the back of your head, perform reverse neck curls for 20-30 reps (raising your neck against gravity and the weight, keeping everything but the neck immobilized). Rest a couple minutes, increase the weight by 5-10 pounds and perform 20-30. Do this one more time for three sets.

For example:

Set 1: 10 pounds for 20 reps
Set 2: 15 pounds for 20 reps
Set 3: 20 pounds for 20 reps
Finally, we have neck curls. This is performed by lying on your back on a bench, with your head off of the bench. Hold a light plate on your forehead and perform neck curls. Start light for 20-30 reps, increase the weight and perform 20-30 reps. Do this once more for three sets.

I recommend not pushing too close to failure or your neck can cramp up. Don’t overdo it. Make sure to control the weight. When you can do the top end of the rep range (30 reps) for your last set, increase the weight next week. 

Last Thing...  
This routine is simple but effective (like any and all of my workouts). The cool thing is you'll notice results in the first few weeks of performing this routine. It really is that effective. Just a little extra direct neck and traps work will make all the difference in the world. 

You'll start to get more compliments on your physique. In fact, when your neck and traps are thick, you'll look way more jacked and get way more attention. (Even more than someone that is actually bigger than you.)

Now, if you start to get your neck and traps to a good level, you can train them once every two weeks. This is a good plan for maintenance mode, avoiding overtraining at the same time. Until then, you can train them once per week (every Friday or Monday). 

Looking forward to seeing your gains : )
