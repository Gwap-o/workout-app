Gregory to the Rescue
My name is Greg O’Gallagher. In this program, I'm going to teach you my methods to building a well-proportioned, strong, muscular physique.

This program is going to be much different than any other strength or muscle building course you have ever read.

The workouts, exercises, sets and reps are all geared towards bringing your body closer to what I call the Kinobody physique. I'm talking about a strong V-shaped torso, sculpted shoulders, prominent, square pecs, rock hard arms, a taut waist and lean legs.

This is the exact physique that I have coined as the Kinobody. In the film industry, "kino" is considered the highest tier of artistry in motion pictures. Flicks, film, movies, cinema ... everything bows before the kino. And, seeing as we want to create that appealing Hollywood physique, it would only make sense to go for the best of the best. Hence, the Kinobody.

At first you might be surprised by the simplicity of the workouts. This is because you won’t be training five to six times per week. You won’t be doing five exercises per muscle group. You won’t be using all kinds of fancy bodybuilding techniques.

Those methods are great if all you care about is getting insane pumps and crazy muscle soreness. However, if you’re more concerned with building real strength and muscle, as well as actually making consistent progress, then you need to abide by a whole new set of rules and training principles.

When it comes to building a lean and muscular physique, we will focus on increasing strength in the 4-8 rep range. This will deliver most of your results. If you focus on gaining strength with the right movements, then you'll gain solid muscle to sculpt your physique - useful, dense, powerful muscle.

In conjunction with a specific diet protocol constructed to minimize fat and promote muscle, you'll be left with a chiseled Greek God look.

Who Is This Program For?

This program is for determined men who want to build the ideal lean and muscular physique of Hollywood’s fittest. I’m talking about guys like Brad Pitt in "Troy," Daniel Craig in "Casino Royale," Christian Bale in "American Psycho," Ryan Reynolds in "Blade: Trinity" and Chris Evans in "Captain America." These guys all have a nice amount of muscle combined with minimal fat.

This program is for determined men who want to be much stronger and more powerful, not those just gunning for looks. “Looking good” won’t cut it.

This program is for men who want to be a godlike in strength AND aesthetics. Some people believe you can’t be lean and strong. I'm here to get you both. By now you've seen my physique, and I can bench press 315 pounds. For reps. You can look good and be strong - have that cake and eat it, too!

By maintaining a level of leanness, we'll be striving for not just strength, but relative strength. (That is, strength compared to your bodyweight.)

This program is for men who like to enjoy life. What’s the point in looking good if your life revolves around your training and diet? Answer: There is no point. It’s a complete waste. In fact, for most people reading this program, they're going to be spending less time in the gym and more time enjoying life. Sorry, gym bros.

This program is for men with patience. You'll have to live with the fact that you won't be gaining 5-10 pounds of muscle per month. The only way to do that is to either be regaining muscle previously lost or using copious amounts of anabolic steroids. We aren't about that stuff here. Plus, those that try to pack on muscle very quickly end up gaining a whole bunch of fat and ultimately ruin their physiques.

Beginner and intermediate lifters can gain a maximum of 2-3 pounds of muscle per month. While this might sound slow, it’s really not. Most people need to gain 15-20 pounds of muscle max to achieve the muscularity of the Kinobody Greek God physique. This takes six months to a year to achieve.

Working out is something that I want you to continue for life. If you could build a jacked physique in two to three months, then there would be a lot more muscular guys (and gals) walking around.

That said, most guys actually think they need to gain 30-40 pounds of muscle to look impressive. This is most definitely not the case. Some people trying to build muscle tend to overeat as well as do lots of squats and deadlifts. This leads to excess fat gain and excess lower body mass. If these people were only to gain 15-20 pounds of muscle, their physiques wouldn’t change a whole lot. However, when you focus on gaining pure muscle and adding that muscle to the right places in the right amounts, then 15-20 pounds looks incredible!

That's what we're trying to accomplish here. We want to get the minimum effective amount of muscle gain and fat loss to achieve a badass physique. If this sounds great to you, let's keep on going!

Chapter 2
The Ultimate Kinobody Physique
Over the years working out and transforming my body, people have always asked me why I work out.

I tell them, “I workout because, as far as I’m concerned, I only have one body and I want it to be as healthy, fit and powerful as possible. So tell me, why don’t you workout? What’s stopping you from making the small investment that is working out and taking care of yourself that will pay off big time?”

As a child I always found it incredible that you determine how your body looks, feels and functions.

Working out a few times per week and taking care of yourself is a small price to pay for a physique that feels and looks amazing and performs well. Don’t you think?


Relative Strength: The Key to the Ultimate Lean and Muscular Physique
What's more impressive: A 220-pound guy that benches 315 pounds, or a 175-pound guy that benches 315?

The 175-pound guy is much more impressive, of course. This is because he's much lighter yet has the same strength as the bigger guy. Therefore, the lighter guy must have a higher percentage of lean body mass (i.e., low body fat) and the muscle he does have is going to be much more dense and powerful.

Relative strength is the key to building the perfect physique.

Get as strong as possible relative to your bodyweight. This will ensure you have a good amount of muscle and very little body fat.

When your strength-to-weight ratio increases, you'll have a good indicator that you gained muscle, lost fat or both.

Every workout should be constructed to maximize strength gains. This is the long-term approach.

From my experience, people get way too caught up in hitting their muscles from different angles, feeling the burn, and using high-fatigue methods such as drop-sets and supersets. These methods have their place but should never replace heavy lifting. One thing remains true: To build muscle, you need to lift heavier and heavier weights over time.

Want to build muscle? Build strength! Want a big chest? Work your way up to 225-pound incline barbell bench press for five reps.

Want a big back? Work up to chinups with 90 pounds attached for five reps.

You will never see someone lacking in the muscle department that can do both those tasks. That I can guarantee.

What you WILL see is someone complaining about his flat chest whose workout routine consists of multiple different chest exercises, all performed to failure with supersets and drop-sets mixed in. Sounds exhausting. Their bench press probably hasn’t improved since the first time they benched 185 pounds. Instead, they should focus on improving strength instead of causing fatigue. Muscle follows strength.

Want to improve muscular endurance? Build strength! I can’t stress how important gaining strength is for improving performance. Building strength is an effective way to improve muscular endurance. For example, who do you think can do more reps with 150 pounds on the bench press: someone who benches 200 pounds or someone who benches 300? Definitely the 300-pound lifter.

Want to increase power? Build strength! Who do you think can launch their body up over a wall with more power, a guy who can do pullups with 100 pounds attached or a guy who can only do pullups with no weight attached? Obviously, it's the first guy.



Want to look awesome? Build relative strength! Building strength relative to your bodyweight is the key to the ultimate physique, one that is lean, powerful and functional. The key to gaining relative strength is to focus on building as much strength as possible while keeping body fat to an absolute minimum. This training program is designed to generate strength gains and the nutrition protocol is designed to keep fat to a minimum and support muscle growth.

The combination of the two results in incredible relative strength.


How to Build Super Strength and Dense Muscle

First thing's first, there are two different forms of muscle growth: myofibrillar hypertrophy and sarcoplasmic hypertrophy.

Myofibrillar hypertrophy is the growth of your muscle fibers and is trigged by lifting heavy weights for low reps (three to eight) with long rest periods. Training for myofibrillar hypertrophy builds hard, dense-looking muscle that will be highly useful since it's accompanied by large strength increases.

Safe to say, we're going to be focusing on this type of muscle growth.

Sarcoplasmic hypertrophy is the growth of the fluid within your muscle cells and is trigged by high-volume lifting with sub-maximal weights and short rest periods.

Sarcoplasmic hypertrophy only accounts for about 25 percent of potential muscle growth. Think of it as the icing on the cake. It doesn’t take much to trigger this additional muscle growth but it will allow you to walk around with five to eight more pounds of muscle.

This type of training is fun to do because it delivers a great muscle pump. Unfortunately, most people get distracted by this type of training and neglect what really matters - building strength. Therefore, this type of lifting will only be a small component of the workout program.

Chapter 3
Revamping Your Training
With this strength training program, we'll be diligently tracking five different exercises that directly contribute to the aesthetic Greek God physique. These key movements are our "indicator exercises," and they'll be our way to ensure that we're making consistent progress.

As you become stronger with these key movements, your body will transform. Your chest, shoulders, arms and back will begin to fill out as you drop fat and gain muscle. You'll move closer to a strong, V-shaped torso, a masculine, square chest, rock-hard shoulders and dense arms.

By tracking your six indicator exercises, you'll have visual proof of the effectiveness of your workout routine. Most people judge their routine based on how tough it is and how sore it makes them. This is an ineffective way to track progress and often misleading.

The effectiveness of your training is directly related to the progress on these five exercises. By accepting that, this training program will become 10 times more efficient. Direct your efforts on what will make you stronger and muscular, and divert your attention away from all other distractions.

Every exercise, every set, every rep has a purpose.

Kinobody Indicator Exercises

1 - Incline Barbell Bench Press

There is nothing wrong with the regular flat bench barbell press. It's a terrific exercise at building the whole pectoral region (if done properly).

That said, I feel most people benefit more from the incline version, which develops the upper pecs more effectively. In addition, in most athletic pressing movements the arms push forward at a slightly upward angle, as opposed to directly straight out. An example of this would be pushing a car or throwing a punch.

For this reason, the incline press might be more relevant from a functional standpoint.


2 - Standing Shoulder Press


This is my go-to exercise for shoulder development and true strength. This exercise also contributes to the square chest look by filling in the top area of the chest, just below the collarbone. In addition, standing presses will work the triceps hard.

I recommend avoiding seated shoulder presses with the elbows flared out to the side. This is a very unnatural position for the shoulders and over time it could cause pain and injury.

By performing standing shoulder presses, your core will be engaged to keep your lower body steady, making it a wonderful compound movement that develops not only your upper body, but your core too.

3 - Weighted Chinups


Chinups have developed my back so well that I’ve actually avoided doing any additional work for my LATs. In addition, chinups hit the biceps hard. LAT pulldowns and all the various rows don’t even come close to the effectiveness of weighted chinups.

With chinups, you can’t cheat and use momentum or a swing like you can with rows and pulldowns. Plus, chinups are a "closed-chain exercise," whereas LAT pulldowns and rows are "open-chain exercises." What this means is that with chinups your hands are fixed to the bar while your body is moving through space.

Open-chained exercises involve the hands moving with the entire body staying fixed in position.
Closed-chain movements have greater overall muscle recruitment and lead to better muscle and strength gains.
4 - Weighted Dips

Weighted dips are an intense exercise that add massive amounts of pressing strength and develop muscle in the triceps and pectoral region.

Some exercises are stubborn when it comes to progressing in weight. Weighted dips are not one of those exercises. They tend to go up smoothly. And, if you train this exercise properly, you should be able to add 45 pounds to this exercise in three months' time. That is a huge gain and would result in bigger triceps, a fuller chest and a stronger bench.

5 - Bulgarian Split Squat or Box Squat

In the program, you have the option of doing either Bulgarian split squats or barbell box squats as your primary leg exercise. Both are effective movements that build strength and stimulate muscle growth. In fact, my favorite approach is to alternate between these two exercises. I’ll spend a couple months doing box squats and couple of months performing Bulgarian split squats. This keeps me progressing, and it also helps me avoid getting burnt out on a movement. Both of these exercises do an amazing job at developing leg strength and building the quads, hamstring and glutes.

If you aren’t able to perform squats safely, then focus predominately on the single-leg movement (Bulgarian split squats). However, focus on squats if you love doing them.

For box squats, I recommend using a box height that puts you parallel at the bottom of the squat. Pause for one second, but don’t completely rest on the box; it’s best to keep some tension. Feel welcome to perform free squats instead. However, the advantage of box squats is that it ensures proper depth on each and every rep. The pause at the bottom of the movement also increases power development. Finally, the box squat does an amazing job at teaching proper squatting mechanics: sitting back, chest up and weight in the heel of the foot.

6 - Romanian Deadlift (Barbell or Dumbbell)

The Romanian deadlift is my favorite deadlift variation. It does an amazing job at developing your posterior chain -- hamstrings, glutes and low back. This deadlift variation is performed by using as much hip drive and hip hinge as possible. It's also safer than conventional deadlifts, plus it works best for higher reps (8-15 reps). Combined with Bulgarian split squats, you can build strong, powerful legs.

I like to utilize both the barbell and dumbbell variations of this movement. A barbell typically allows you to lift more weight, but the dumbbell version allows for a greater range and improve on imbalances. I recommend utilizing both variations. Focus on the dumbbell version for a couple months, then switch to barbell.

Kinobody Assistance Movements

I always include additional exercises into the workout routines I create. You could exclusively train with the five indicator exercises and build a great physique. However, it's likely that, over time, you'll have lagging muscle groups and hit strength plateaus.

To ensure complete physique development and optimal muscle gains, I include assistance movements. These are my favorites:

Close-Grip Bench Press


The close-grip bench is a phenomenal pressing movement that builds a powerful chest and triceps. By using a close-grip -- with the elbows tucked into your sides -- you increase muscle recruitment in the triceps and upper chest.


Barbell Curls


The barbell curl is the best exercise for developing the biceps. With this movement, you can make gradual progress in resistance.

In most biceps exercises, little strength increase is actually seen. For this reason, I use barbell curls as my main biceps exercise. You can eventually build up to barbell curls with 135 pounds for reps, increasing by 5 or even 2.5 pounds per session.

Incline Dumbbell Curls


Incline dumbbell curls are also very effective for the biceps because your arms are locked to the sides and your back is flat against the bench. In this position, you're unable to use any back swing; the biceps are forced to work in isolation.

I like to alternate between barbell curls and incline dumbbell curls for 3-4 weeks for each. This lets you escape plateaus and keeps your biceps guessing.


Skull Crushers


Skull crushers hit the triceps like crazy and allow for regular loading in weight. For this reason, skull crushers should be your main triceps movement.

As with barbell curls, you can build up to 135 pounds for several reps. This is a killer exercise and will translate to better pushing strength, specifically in the lockout position.



Rope Extensions


Rope triceps pushdowns (a.k.a. rope extensions) are another great triceps exercise. This movement is better suited for higher reps, less weight and short rest periods. For that reason, I like to use them for Kino rep training and rest-pause training (which we will get into in a later section).

Lateral Raises


To ensure solid shoulder development, I always include lateral raises in my workout programs. The medial head of the deltoid never gets fully worked with shoulder pressing. Most of the stress for shoulder pressing is placed on the anterior head. For this reason, the medial head can slightly lag behind in overall growth. Therefore, lateral raises should be incorporated to ensure even muscle growth.

In addition, by adequately building the medial head of the shoulder, you'll contribute to the V-shaped frame that we're looking for.


Bent-Over Flyes


Strong rear deltoids will help keep your shoulders balanced and healthy. This will keep you injury-free from heavy pressing movements. Well-developed rear deltoids will complete the shoulders, giving them a full, rounded appearance. However, make sure you have correct form with these. Your rear deltoids are rarely utilized in normal motions and could be very weak starting out. Don't try for a heavy weight, or you might get injured in the middle of your back, putting you out of commission for weeks.

This is the last exercise to create the full, capped shoulders that scream power and strength.


One-Legged Squats (a.k.a. Pistols)


Pistol squats are an unbelievable exercise that I regularly incorporate into my routine.

The benefits of mastering the pistol squat are enormous. The pistol requires great balance, leg strength, flexibility and coordination. For most people, building up to 6-10 reps per leg -- slow and controlled -- is enough for adequate leg strength and development.

You can perform this exercise holding a weight in your hands to increase the difficulty. Another option is to perform jumping pistol squats, where you explode up from the bottom position into a single leg jump. If you can get to this level, your legs will be looking the part.

Elevated Single-Leg Calf Raises


I feel it's important to do some direct lower leg training. Small calves create the illusion of chicken legs, which deters us from our goal. By training your calves and keeping them around the same size as your upper arm, you'll help yourself with balance and proportion.

---

For chinups and dips, you need a belt that A) you can attach additional weight in the form of barbell plates to, and B) doesn't bunch you up and have you feeling uncomfortable.

That's where the Kino Belt comes in. The belt feels amazing, even with multiple 45-pound plates attached in the front. It distributes weight in an ideal way and allows you to focus on what's most important -- the reps.

Chapter 4
Reverse Pyramid Training:
Maximizing Muscle and Strength Gains
Reverse pyramid training is by far the most effective training style I've ever used to build both muscle and strength.

Unfortunately, few people employ this very simple technique. In fact, most people train in the exact opposite way, by grabbing a weight and pumping out 12-15 reps. After a brief rest, they'll add weight and pump out another 10-12 reps. They repeat this process until they hit a weight that causes them to hit failure in the 5-8 rep range.

The problem with this progression strategy is that they become fatigued for their heaviest set. As a result, they end up using a weight that's lighter than their true 5-8 rep max. Because they're lifting below their true potential, they never promote optimal strength and muscle gains.

I recommend flipping the script and performing your heaviest set first, while you are completely fresh.

Your heavy set is the most productive set. It has the greatest capacity to trigger maximum strength and muscle gains. However, in order to get the maximum training effect, it's essential to begin with the heaviest set.

After performing your heavy set -- and scoring a nice personal record in the process -- you can follow it up with a few more sets of gradually reduced weight loads. The subsequent sets will be less demanding on your neural system, since you'll be lifting lighter loads.

This is crucial because we don’t want to overtax our nervous systems. The purpose of these extra sets is to simply provide more volume to the working muscles. This will encourage optimal muscle gains.

Now, here's where the magic of reverse pyramid training comes in...

You'll notice that your heavy set will make your subsequent sets feel lighter. The heavy set induces a high degree of central nervous system stimulation, resulting in greater motor unit recruitment and force, which can last for several minutes. As a result, you get more efficient muscle fiber recruitment with lighter weights after your heavy set.

Since you get more muscle fiber activation in your lighter sets, you'll be stimulating hypertrophy (a.k.a. muscle growth). This is because with loads below 80-85 percent of your one-rep max (1RM), many of your muscle fibers don’t get activated until the last few reps.

With reverse pyramid training, you can get those muscle fibers to come into play from the very first rep. This is a huge deal when it comes to maximizing muscle growth.

Warming Up For Your Heavy Set

We can’t jump right into our heavy set or injury will be inevitable. For that reason, I recommend a specific warmup.

The best way to prepare for your heavy set -- while avoiding fatigue -- is to perform two or three buildup sets for only one to five reps.

I usually recommend using a weight that is 60 percent of your working-set weight for five reps, then 75 percent of your working set weight for three reps and then 90 percent of your work set weight for one rep.

You should rest around two minutes between these buildup sets and a full three minutes before doing your first working set.

The warmup sets are only necessary for the first exercise of any given workout. After that, you should be ready to jump right into your working sets for all remaining exercises.

That being said, you should judge how you feel. If you think you need a couple buildup sets, then take them. (Better that than risk injury.)

Here's an example of three buildup sets for a 225-pound bench press:

135 pounds x 5 reps (60 percent)
170 pounds x 3 reps (75 percent)
200 pounds x 1 reps (90 percent)
Reverse Pyramid Training Specifics

Generally, your heavy set should be performed with a weight that allows you to perform between 4-8 reps with maximum effort (stopping one rep shy of failure).

After performing your first set, you should reduce the weight by about 10 percent and then perform your second set, striving for one or two more reps.

If you're doing three sets, then you'll reduce the weight by another 10 percent and shoot for an additional one to two reps.

For example:

225 pounds x 5 reps (heavy set, max effort; rest three minutes)
205 pounds x 6 reps (rest three minutes)
185 pounds x 8 reps (rest three minutes)
You should take at least three minutes rest between these sets for maximum recovery and lifting performance. Rushing through these sets will drastically reduce your strength capabilities.

That's all she wrote on reverse pyramid training! This will be the focal point of the training protocol, so get familiar with this type of set/rep/load structure and learn how to make progress by doing your heaviest set first.

Chapter 5
Kino Rep Training
In addition to reverse pyramid training, we'll also integrate Kino rep training. This is an effective training style that increases volume to spur maximum muscle growth. It involves a mix of intensity (weight lifted), volume (total reps performed) and your strength progression. 

Combining heavy, intense reverse pyramid training with Kino rep training will produce the ultimate Greek God look.

What Is Kino Rep Training?
Kino rep training is a training style I designed to achieve volume gains without draining the nervous system. 

This training style is performed by starting with a relatively light weight for 10-12 reps. Then, you increase the weight and perform another set of 10-12 reps. You'll increase the weight for a third set of 10-12 reps. You can continue this for up to five total sets. 

By starting light, we pre-fatigue the muscles. This means we don’t have to go quite as heavy to achieve muscle failure. 

I sometimes use this strategy at the end of my workout, especially leg training because it helps me avoid burn out. Since the legs are big muscle groups, going really heavy via reverse pyramid training can quickly tax your nervous system.

So, think of Kino rep training as a strategic addition to the program. It’s designed to fill in the gaps. If this is the only training style you do, you'll never reach your maximum muscle potential. 
That said, if you combine this with a big focus on reverse pyramid training, Kino rep training will help you gain an extra 20 percent of muscle gains, creating the perfect Greek God physique you're after.

What’s more, this training style can be very fun. Plus, it can boost your conditioning and stamina quite a bit. I recommend resting for shorter periods of time with Kino rep training -- 60-90 seconds works best.

For example: When performing dumbbell Romanian deadlifts, I call for four sets of 10-12 reps. You may do this: 

Dumbbell Romanian Deadlifts: 4 sets x 10-12 reps (Kino rep training) 

40 pounds x 12 reps
50 pounds x 12 reps
60 pounds x 12 reps 
70 pounds x 10 reps 
Or perhaps the exercise is face pulls for four sets of 15 reps 

Cable Face Pulls: 4 sets x 15 reps (Kino rep training)

80 pounds x 15 
90 pounds x 15 
100 pounds x 15
110 pounds x 15 reps 
Another powerful benefit to Kino rep training is it helps you build the mind-to-muscle connection. Since we’re doing higher reps and lots of light sets, you'll learn how to really feel and squeeze your muscle. This will help you gain more muscle when you do your heavy lifting sets. 

This, I believe, is the best complimentary exercise strategy to use in your workout routine, other than rest-pause training.

Speak of which...

Chapter 6
Rest-Pause Training
There's one final training style we'll use in this program, and that’s rest-pause training. I pretty much use this for shoulder exercises like lateral raises and rear deltoid flyes. There’s a reason why thousands of men who've gone through this program have some of the best shoulders on this world. 

Rest-pause training is an effective training style to maximize muscle growth without having to lift heavy weights. It’s fast, effective and tough as hell! 
The reason why lifting heavy weights for 4-8 reps works so well to gain muscle is because your body is forced to recruit all of the muscle fibers from the very first rep. 

If you were to use a light weight for 10-15 reps, your body would only start using maximum muscle fiber recruitment on the last few challenging reps. 

What does this mean? It means that for heavy lifting, every single rep is incredibly productive and effective. But for light weights, it’s only the last few reps that really ignite muscle growth. 

What's the solution? Interestingly enough, if you were to limit your rest to only 10-15 seconds, your body will still be in a state of increased muscle fiber recruitment.

So the solution is to do an all out set for 12-15 reps; then, rest for 10-15 seconds and perform 4-6 reps (using the same weight). Rest 10-15 seconds and perform 4-6 reps. Rest 10-15 seconds and perform 4-6 reps.

This strategy allows you to get more effective reps that lead to better muscle growth. I’ve found rest-pause training to be most effective for shoulders (lateral raises and rear deltoid flyes). 

By combining reverse pyramid training, rest-pause training and Kino rep training, we can experience optimal muscle growth and build the body of a Greek God.

Too many people get stuck on one thing. That one thing, whatever it is, works until it doesn’t.

I’ve found that the combination of these three training styles to be most effective, and I can’t wait for you to experience them. 

Chapter 7

The Art of Strength Progressions

The key to building a great physique is to develop strength with the key lifts of the Greek God 2.0 workouts. Now, I can give you the perfect training plan and nutrition strategy, but you still won't see results if you're not dedicated to properly increasing the weight as you move through the course.

Poor results occur when we plateau because we try to increase the weight too quickly. Over time, the plateau is compounded by only being able to lift the same weight for months on end, with little to no change in your physique.

This is what most people do at the gym.

I’ve discovered the sweet spot to increasing strength consistently and systematically. The Kinobody philosophy works like clockwork. When you’re able to nail down the strategy for strength progressions, your physique will improve week by week.

You'll build hard, dense muscle when your strength increase by 20-50 pounds on your key exercises.

I've uncovered the secret to increasing strength and stimulating muscle growth through years of research and personal experience.

I call it the double progression model.

The Double Progression Model

The double progression model is when we drill down a rep range, and once we hit the top end of that range, we increase the load and decrease the reps during the next workout.

I’d absolutely love it if I could tell you to just add five pounds every workout. Unfortunately, that’s just not realistic. Sure, you may be able to do it for a few weeks or maybe even a month or two. But eventually, you'll hit a plateau.

(That said, there are a few exercises that you may be able to go up by five pounds every workout: squats, deadlifts and weighted dips, for instance.)

The weighted dip is literally the only upper body exercise I’ve been able to consistently up by five pounds per workout (while hitting the same reps).

To help you with the double progression model, the Greek God Program provides you with rep ranges for all of your workouts. The rep range may call for 4-5 reps. When you can do five reps, the next workout you will increase the weight by five pounds, but go back to performing four reps. The following workout, you'll use the same weight and then go for five reps. Rinse and repeat.

Example of the Double Progression Model

Incline Press (Set 1)

Workout 1: 200 pounds x 5 reps
Workout 2: 205 pounds x 4 reps
Workout 3: 205 pounds x 5 reps
Workout 4: 210 pounds x 4 reps
Workout 5: 210 pounds x 5 reps
Workout 6: 215 pounds x 4 reps
In about six workouts, you’re going to increase the weight by 15 pounds, which is the ideal rate for strength gains. There’s little to no benefit to increase the weight faster than this. Even if you could jump the weight up by 10 pounds in a week, you won’t even be able to realize those muscle gains. It takes time for your body to pack on muscle. So, increasing your weight on your key lifts by 10-15 pounds per month is optimal.

This example works well for heavy compound barbell exercises. Some exercises -- particularly lighter movements and dumbbell exercises -- will need to have a wider rep range.

Dumbbell exercises increase the weight by five pounds per hand (10 pounds total). Therefore, you need to give yourself more room to work with before increasing the weight, since your reps may drop by two or three.

In this case, you'd perform 4-6 reps, 6-8 reps or 8-10 reps (first set, second set and third set, respectively). Therefore, you’d keep the weight the same until you can hit the top end of the rep range.

Dumbbell Curls (Set 1)

Workout 1: 35 pounds x 4 reps
Workout 2: 35 pounds x 5 reps
Workout 3: 35 pounds x 6 reps
Workout 4: 40 pounds x 4 reps
Workout 5: 40 pounds x 5 reps
Workout 6: 40 pounds x 6 reps
Closed-Chain Movements

The Greek God Program utilizes a heavy dose of weighted chinups. As well, many of the routines will incorporate weighted dips. These exercises are intense and effective for muscle development. Both are examples of closed-chain movements, which are exercises where your hands are fixed and your body moves through a certain plane.

Closed-chain movements give you a neuromuscular advantage. Plus, the beauty of weighted chinups and weighted dips is that we can increase the weight by just 2.5 pounds per workout. This is accomplished by adding a 2.5 pound weight plate to your chinup belt. By adding just 2.5 pounds per workout, there’s no need to adjust the reps. You'll be able to increase by 2.5 pounds per workout for weeks on end without ever dropping your reps.

What if I Hit a Strength Plateau?

Even with an intelligent and methodical progression model, you'll still inevitably hit a plateau. If you follow this progression model perfectly, you will be adding 15 pounds per month to your key lifts. This is because we're doing a two-day workout split, alternating between Workout A and Workout B three times per week. Every month, you'll be performing every workout six times, twelve workouts total.

If you were to increase your strength every workout for a year, you would be adding 180 pounds to your lifts. In three years, you would be the strongest person in the world with incline presses of 600 pounds and doing 500-pound chinups!

Unfortunately, it’s not quite that simple. But, don’t worry; the Greek God Program 2.0 provides a solution...

Most people who hit a plateau completely screw up. They freak out! Their bench press stalls, so they decide to go on some crazy bench press specialization program and start bench pressing five days per week.

This is the wrong solution. If their strength increases, it’s simply due to practicing the movement so often. But usually what happens is their strength goes down.

A plateau is your body giving you a signal. When you burn out on an exercise, your body is telling you to mix it up!

It wants a new challenge, a new stressor. When you repeatedly perform the same exercises and routines for months on end, you'll get stuck. Your body adapts to the predicable stimulus and stops changing.

This is how the muscle confusion principle began. People realized if they kept doing the same exercises, they would hit a plateau.

So, they went from one direction to the exact opposite direction by mixing things up every single week. This doesn’t work either because if you change things every week, it’s impossible to improve. You have literally zero way to gauge improvement if you’re always modifying your workout.

The solution isn’t to do the same thing every week for months on end. And the solution isn’t to change things up every single week.

The solution is way more methodical. It's to ride the strength wave as long as you can. When that wave knocks you off your board (your strength gets stuck), then it’s time to hop on a different wave (new exercises).

Change up the routine. When I say change up the routine, I really mean change up your exercises. Or rather, rotate your exercises by performing a slightly different variation.

For example, if you’re stuck on your incline barbell bench press, you can switch to incline dumbbell bench press. If you’re stuck on weighted chinups, you can work on weighted pullups. If your standing press is stuck, you can perform a different pressing movement.

In any case, you’re essentially performing the same movement and working the same muscles, but in a different way. Both variations will support each other. The stronger you get on the barbell incline press, the stronger you'll be on incline dumbbell presses and vice versa.

In fact, for my overhead press, I like to alternate doing a couple months of overhead press, then instead of doing more shoulder-focused exercises, I’ll work on my weighted dips or more bench. This helps increase my chest size.

The Greek God 2.0 strategy makes training really, really fun. You’ll find that when you switch the routine up, you get a new sense of vigor. You get really excited to smash your next workout.

I’ve used this system to achieve some pretty damn insane lifts at a bodyweight of 180-185 pounds, including a 315-pound incline bench press for two reps and shoulder pressing 120-pound dumbbells for six reps.

Chapter 8
Optimal Training Frequency
This is a huge debate topic in the fitness industry. In fact, everywhere you go you’ll likely find a different answer. Time to put it all to rest right here:


Lifting Days Per Week

Three strength training sessions per week is the optimal training frequency for strength and muscle gains.

Taking a day off from lifting between strength training sessions allows your body to recover. Also, this day of rest gives your central nervous system a chance to recharge.

By lifting only three times per week on non-consecutive days, you can hit the gym with maximum effort and productivity. You'll always be lifting near your true potential, and strength and muscle gains will be maximized.

You will be able to make the maximum rate of gains by only lifting three times per week. There is no additional benefit from training four, five, or even six times per week. It becomes very counterproductive because recovery capabilities are reduced.

Muscle and Movement Frequency
After an intense lifting session, your muscles actually recover quite quickly. There's tons of research on muscular recovery indicating that a muscle can be loaded as often as every 48 hours.

But muscle recovery is only one side of the story.

When you lift heavy, you create lots of neural fatigue. You drain your central nervous system and your local nerves that fire a particular muscle group. When these nerves are fatigued, a given muscle group will be short of strength until it's given enough time to recover.

The CNS takes around 48 hours to recover, much like your muscles. However the local nerves may take three to four days before they are fully recharged after a heavy lifting session.

For this reason your best bet is to lift every other day or three times per week on non-consecutive days. This gives your central nervous system a chance to fully recharge before your next strength workout.

In addition, you should only hit each muscle group every four to five days to give the local nerves a chance to fully recover. The best way to do this is to split your body into two workouts.

Here’s an example split: chest, shoulders, triceps (Workout A) and back, biceps, legs (Workout B).

Simply alternate between these workouts three times per week. This is what it would look like:

Week 1:

Monday - Workout A
Wednesday - Workout B
Friday - Workout A
Week 2:

Monday - Workout B
Wednesday - Workout A
Friday - Workout B

Resting a full week before hitting the same muscle group is generally too much time for maximizing growth and strength gains. Protein synthesis returns to normal in a muscle group after a few days and your muscles' strength abilities peak four to five days after being trained. When you wait a full week, many of your muscles' positive adaptations start to return to normal during those last couple days of rest.

Therefore, the minimally effective dose of training is three times per week, with the whole body split into two different workouts.

Chapter 9

The Greek God 2.0 Workout Program for Strength and Density

Duration: Six months

Goal: Rapidly increase strength on key lifts for dense muscle growth.

Now for the part you’ve actually been waiting for: the Greek God workout routine!

The first training routine focuses on accelerating strength gains with key lifts. We'll be training as efficiently as possible with the sole goal of rapidly increasing strength.

As we increase your incline press by 30 pounds, your chest is going to fill out nicely.
When your weighted chinup increases by 30 pounds, your back and biceps will start to pop.
As you increase strength on your standing press and leg lifts, you’re going to experience incredible changes to your physique.
Remember, the stronger you get with these key lifts, the better you will look. This routine is about to create the best strength gains of your entire life.

As outlined previously, you'll be working out three days per week, alternating between two different workouts.

Workout A is focused on chest, shoulders, triceps and abs.
Workout B is focused on back, biceps and legs.
Here's how to schedule your Greek God training:

Week One: Workout A, Workout B, Workout A
Week Two: Workout B, Workout A, Workout B
I recommend lifting on non-consecutive days such as Monday/Wednesday/Friday or Tuesday/Thursday/Saturday. This works best for maximum recovery, which means every single workout you'll be able to hit personal records. Your body will turn into a strength building and muscle gaining machine.

Phase One: Shoulder Emphasis (8 Weeks)

The first phase will do a fantastic job building the Greek God physique by focusing on incline pressing, overhead pressing and weighted chinups. You'll build a square, masculine chest, full, rounded shoulders and a powerful back.

You'll also train the lower body with the proven amount of intensity and volume to develop proportionate and athletic legs.

Workout A (Phase One)

Incline Barbell Press: 3 sets x 4-5, 6-7, 8-10 reps (reverse pyramid training)
Standing Press: 3 sets x 6-8, 8-10, 8-10 reps (reverse pyramid training)
Triceps Rope Pushdowns: 3 sets x 6-8, 8-10, 10-12 reps (reverse pyramid training)
Lateral Raises: 1 set x 12-15 reps + 3 mini-sets x 4-6 reps (rest-pause training)
Hanging Knee Raises: 3 sets x 8-12 reps (straight sets)
Workout A Notes

This routine is focused on chest, shoulders, triceps and abs.

Incline Barbell Press

We start with the incline barbell press. I recommend performing a few warmup sets with progressively heavier weight.

For example:

50 percent of your heavy set weight for 6 reps
70 percent of your heavy set weight for 5 reps
80 percent of your heavy set weight for 3 reps
If your goal is to do 200 pounds, you'd do 100 pounds for six reps, 140 pounds for five reps and 160 pounds for three reps. This progression is designed to warm you up without inducing fatigue.

Incline Press

Perform your heaviest set for 4-5 reps. If you achieve the full five reps, remember to increase the weight the next workout and go for four reps.
After resting for three minutes, drop the weight by 10 percent and go for 6-7 reps. If you can perform seven reps, increase the weight the next workout.
Finally, drop the weight by 10 percent again and perform 8-10 reps. When you achieve 10 reps, increase the weight on the next workout.
It’s important to note: You should be able to perform your first set with good form. But for the second and third set, try not to kill yourself. Leave a rep in the tank. (Meaning your last rep shouldn’t be all out.)

After incline press, I recommend resting 4-5 minutes before moving on to the standing press.

Standing Press

Begin by using a weight you can lift for 6-8 reps. If you get eight reps, increase the weight next workout
Rest three minutes, drop the weight by 10 percent and go for 8-10 reps. If you get 10 reps, then increase by five pounds for the next workout
Finally, drop the weight by 10 percent and perform another set of 10 reps
This should feel pretty easy. At this point of the workout, we’ve done the most effective, difficult exercises.

Now it’s time to get in a little more isolation work to complete our physique.

Triceps Rope Pushdowns

Rope pushdowns help develop the triceps.

Perform your heaviest set first for 6-8 reps
Rest two minutes, drop the weight by 10 percent and go for 8-10 reps
Rest two minutes, drop the weight by 10 percent and go for 10-12 reps
When you can do the top end of the rep range on all three sets, increase the weight the next workout.

Lateral Raises

Begin with a weight you can do for 12-15 reps all out
After performing the activation set (12-15 reps), you'll rest 10-15 seconds between each mini-set and perform three mini-sets of 4-6 reps
When you can do 15 reps on your first set, followed by six reps on all mini-sets, increase the weight the next workout. This is the rest-pause training we talked about previously, and it efficiently develops shoulder mass.

Hanging Knee Raises

Finally, finish off with three sets of hanging knee raises to your chest. If this is too easy, hold a weight between your legs.

When you can complete 3 sets of 12 reps, increase the weight. Rest for only a minute between sets.
Workout B (Phase One)

Weighted Chinups: 3 sets x 4, 6, 8 reps (reverse pyramid training)
Incline Dumbbell Hammer Curls: 3 sets x 6-8, 6-8, 8-10 reps (reverse pyramid training)
Bulgarian Split Squats: 4 sets x 6-8 reps (Kino rep training)
Dumbbell Romanian Deadlifts: 4 sets x 10-12 reps (Kino rep training)
Face Pulls: 4 sets x 12-15 reps (Kino rep training)
Workout B Notes

Workout B is focused on back, biceps and legs.

Weighted Chinups

I recommend performing two warmup sets with progressively heavier weight.

For example:

Bodyweight for 5 reps
Half of your heavy set weight for 3 reps
If you can do 40-pound chinups, then warmup with bodyweight for five reps and then 20 pounds for three reps.

For weighted chin ups:

Do your heaviest set for 4 reps and rest three minutes
Drop the weight by about 20-30 pounds, perform 6 reps and rest three minutes
Drop the weight by about 20-30 pounds and perform 8 reps
Increase the weight by 2.5 pounds on all sets the next workout
For example:

40 pounds for 4 reps
20 pounds for 6 reps
Bodyweight for 8 reps
If you can’t do weighted chinups, just do three sets at bodyweight. If you can’t do bodyweight chinups, substitute LAT pulldowns for three sets (6-8, 8-10, 10-12 reps) until you can rep out your bodyweight.

Incline Dumbbell Hammer Curls

Next we'll be doing incline dumbbell hammer curls.

Perform your heaviest set first for 6-8 reps and rest two minutes
Drop the weight by 5 pounds per dumbbell, perform another set of 6-8 reps, and rest two minutes
Drop the weight by 5 pounds each dumbbell and perform your final set for 8-10 reps
For example:

40 pounds for 6 reps
35 pounds for 7 reps
30 pounds for 10 reps
When you can do the top end of the rep range on all three sets, increase the weight by 5 pounds during the next workout.

Bulgarian Split Squats

Now, we get into some leg training. Bulgarian split squats are a powerful exercise that develop leg strength and muscle. Perform Bulgarian split squats Kino Rep Training-style by beginning with light weights and increasing the load with each set (resting for two minutes between sets). Below is my recommended starting point that you can adjust according to your ability:

Set 1: 10 pounds per hand for 6-8 reps
Set 2: 20 pounds per hand for 6-8 reps
Set 3: 30 pounds per hand for 6-8 reps
Set 4: 40 pounds per hand for 6-8 reps
When you can do all four sets for eight reps, increase the weight by 5 pounds per hand for all sets. If you go too heavy and your third set is your max, simply perform that same weight for your fourth set.

Eventually, you'll build up to

Set 1: 40 pounds for 8 reps
Set 2: 50 pounds for 8 reps
Set 3: 60 pounds for 8 reps
Set 4: 70 pounds for 8 reps
When you've developed weight loads at this level, your legs will be athletic and well-developed.

Dumbbell Romanian Deadlifts

Next, you've got dumbbell Romanian deadlifts for four sets of 10-12 (Kino rep training-style). I recommend starting with:

Set 1: 30 pounds for 12 reps
Set 2: 40 pounds for 12 reps
Set 3: 50 pounds for 12 reps
Set 4: 60 pounds for 12 reps
This may seem easy, but it’s a remarkable workout. When you can do all four sets for 12 reps, increase by 5 pounds per dumbbell on each set.

When you can build up to 60 pounds for 12 reps, 70 pounds for 12 reps, 80 pounds for 12 reps and 90 pounds for 12 reps, you'll have a solid posterior chain and thick forearms.

Face Pulls

Finally, you finish off by hitting the rear deltoids and middle traps. This is best accomplished with a face pull. We will be doing this Kino rep training-style.

Start with a light load for 12-15 reps
Increase the weight each set for 4 total sets
When you can do all four sets for 15 reps, increase the weight next workout.

Phase Two: Chest Emphasis (8 Weeks)

By this point of the Greek God Program 2.0, you should be seeing significant, impressive gains. In fact, I bet dollars to donuts that your incline press and weighted chinup has improved massively. By phase two, most of our clients are up 20, 30, even 40 pounds on their lifts. This is freaking unreal!

Now, it’s time to keep improving.

Phase two of the Greek God Program 2.0 incorporates a few classic exercises into the rotation, including a focus on the weighted dip instead of the overhead press. This will give you a mental break from intense overhead press, and you'll experience dramatic chest gains with the weighted dip. This routine will fill out your chest significantly.

And don’t worry, you won’t lose any shoulder size. Your shoulders will get plenty of indirect work from dips, incline bench press, lateral raises and face pulls. Your shoulders will keep improving.

If you're unable to perform dips, substitute with a barbell bench press instead.

Workout A (Phase Two)

Incline Dumbbell Press: 3 sets x 6-8, 8-10, 10-12 reps (reverse pyramid training)
Weighted Dips: 3 sets x 6, 8, 10 reps (reverse pyramid training)
One-Arm Overhead Triceps Extensions: 3 sets x 8-10, 10-12, 12-15 reps (reverse pyramid training)
Dumbbell Upright Rows: 4 sets x 10-15 reps (Kino rep training)
Side-to-Side Knee Ups: 3 sets x 8-12 reps per side (straight sets)
Workout A Notes

Incline Dumbbell Press

The incline dumbbell press is an intense exercise that develops the upper chest.

Begin with a few warmup sets at a light weight
For your first set, use a heavy weight you can perform for 6-8 reps
Rest three minutes, drop the weight by 10 pounds per dumbbell, and go for 8-10 reps
Rest three minutes, drop the weight by 10 pounds per dumbbell, and go for 10-12 reps
When you can do the top end of the rep range for all sets, increase the weight by 5 pounds per dumbbell next workout.

Weighted Dips

Perform the weighted dip sets reverse pyramid-style. Reduce the weight by about 30 pounds each set. So if you begin with 60 pounds for the first set, drop to 30 pounds for the second set and bodyweight for the final set. If you're beginning with 20-30 pound weighted dips, then perform bodyweight for the second and third set.

I recommend increasing the weight by 2.5-5 pounds every single workout.

One-Arm Overhead Triceps Extensions

For triceps, you'll perform one-arm overhead triceps extensions.

Start with a weight you can do for 8-10 reps
Drop the weight by 5 pounds and go for 10-12 reps
Drop the weight by 5 pounds and go for 12-15 reps
Rest 2 mins between sets.
Dumbbell Upright Rows

Complete four sets of dumbbell upright rows Kino rep training-style. I recommend starting with:

20 pounds for 15 reps
25 pounds for 15 reps
30 pounds for 15 reps
35 pounds for 12 reps
When the weight becomes easy, increase it the next workout.

Side-to-Side Knee Ups

Finally, finish off the workout with side-to-side knee ups.

If the knee ups are too easy, hold a light weight between your knees.

Workout B (Phase Two)

Weighted Pullups: 3 sets x 6, 8, 8 (reverse pyramid training)
Incline Dumbbell Bicep Curls: 3 sets x 6-8 reps (reverse pyramid training)
Box Squats: 5 sets x 6 reps (Kino rep training)
Single-Leg Romanian Deadlifts or Barbell Hip Thrusts: 3 sets x 8-12 reps (Kino rep training)
Seated Bent-Over Flyes: 1 set x 12-15 reps + 3 mini-sets x 4-6 reps (rest-pause training)
Workout B Notes

For this new phase, switch to weighted pullups. Perform a couple warmup sets, then perform your heaviest set first for 6 reps. Drop the weight 20-30 pounds and perform 8 reps. Drop the weight by 20-30 pounds and perform another set of 8.

Increase the weight by 2.5 pounds per set every workout.

Incline Dumbbell Bicep Curls

Next, we will be doing incline hammer dumbbell curls.

Perform your heaviest set first for 6-8 reps and rest two minutes
Drop the weight by 5 pounds per dumbbell, perform another set of 6-8 reps and rest two minutes
Drop the weight by 5 pounds and perform your final set for 6-8 reps
For example:

40 pounds for 6 reps
35 pounds for 7 reps
30 pounds for 8 reps
When you can do the top end of the rep range on all three sets, increase the weight by 5 pounds the next workout.

Barbell Box Squat

Now, you go into some leg training. Start with barbell box squats to parallel. Perform five sets of six reps per set, increasing the load each set. Rest two minutes between sets.

For example:

135 pounds for 6 reps
165 pounds for 6 reps
195 pound for 6 reps
225 pounds for 6 reps
255 pounds for 6 reps
If the weight is too heavy by your fourth or fifth set, simply stay at that weight. Increase the load each workout by five pounds.

Single-Leg Romanian Deadlift

Next, do single-leg Romanian deadlifts. This is a great exercise to develop your balance, knee stability and to build your hamstrings and glutes. Romanian deadlifts also pair nicely with box squats.

(Substitute with hip thrusts, if you prefer.)

Perform 8-12 reps per leg. Start with a light weight and increase the load every set. When you can do three sets of 12 reps, increase the weight the next workout. Rest two minutes between sets.

Seated Bent-Over Flyes

Finally, finish off with rest-pause-style seated bent-over flyes. Perform a weight you can do for 12-15 reps. Rest 10-15 seconds between each mini-set and with the same weight perform three mini-sets of 4-6 reps. When you can do 15 reps and three sets of six reps, increase the weight next workout.

Phase Three (Final 8 weeks)

For the final eight weeks of strength and density, you'll return to the routine in phase one. The reason is to keep increasing your key lifts (barbell incline press, standing press and weighted chinup).

You'll notice that, after doing phase two and different exercises, you feel strong and invigorated, and you'll progress on the key movements quickly.

By the end of these eight weeks, your physique will be marbled and shredded. In fact, you should be about 50-60 pounds stronger across the board. Your body will be infinitely stronger, harder and more developed.

Now, of course, this is when both your commitment and the Greek God Program 2.0 begins to really pay dividends. In the next module, we'll drill down into more advanced training strategies to supercharge muscle growth from all that strength you’ve been building. But first, give yourself some huge props for finishing the first six months of the Greek God Program 2.0!

Workout A (Phase Three)

Incline Barbell Press: 3 sets x 4-5, 6-7, 8-10 reps (reverse pyramid training)
