    "content": "My name is Greg O’Gallagher. In this program, I'm going to teach you my methods to building a well-proportioned, strong, muscular physique.\r\n\r\nThis program is going to be much different than any other strength or muscle building course you have ever read.\r\n\r\nThe workouts, exercises, sets and reps are all geared towards bringing your body closer to what I call the Kinobody physique. I'm talking about a strong V-shaped torso, sculpted shoulders, prominent, square pecs, rock hard arms, a taut waist and lean legs.\r\n\r\nThis is the exact physique that I have coined as the Kinobody. In the film industry, \"kino\" is considered the highest tier of artistry in motion pictures. Flicks, film, movies, cinema ... everything bows before the kino. And, seeing as we want to create that appealing Hollywood physique, it would only make sense to go for the best of the best. Hence, the Kinobody.\r\n\r\nAt first you might be surprised by the simplicity of the workouts. This is because you won’t be training five to six times per week. You won’t be doing five exercises per muscle group. You won’t be using all kinds of fancy bodybuilding techniques.\r\n\r\nThose methods are great if all you care about is getting insane pumps and crazy muscle soreness. However, if you’re more concerned with building real strength and muscle, as well as actually making consistent progress, then you need to abide by a whole new set of rules and training principles.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to building a lean and muscular physique, we will focus on increasing strength in the 4-8 rep range. This will deliver most of your results. If you focus on gaining strength with the right movements, then you'll gain solid muscle to sculpt your physique - useful, dense, powerful muscle.\r\n\r\nIn conjunction with a specific diet protocol constructed to minimize fat and promote muscle, you'll be left with a chiseled Greek God look.\r\n\r\nWho Is This Program For?\r\n\r\nThis program is for determined men who want to build the ideal lean and muscular physique of Hollywood’s fittest. I’m talking about guys like Brad Pitt in \"Troy,\" Daniel Craig in \"Casino Royale,\" Christian Bale in \"American Psycho,\" Ryan Reynolds in \"Blade: Trinity\" and Chris Evans in \"Captain America.\" These guys all have a nice amount of muscle combined with minimal fat.\r\n\r\nThis program is for determined men who want to be much stronger and more powerful, not those just gunning for looks. “Looking good” won’t cut it.\r\n\r\nThis program is for men who want to be a godlike in strength AND aesthetics. Some people believe you can’t be lean and strong. I'm here to get you both. By now you've seen my physique, and I can bench press 315 pounds. For reps. You can look good and be strong - have that cake and eat it, too!\r\n\r\nBy maintaining a level of leanness, we'll be striving for not just strength, but relative strength. (That is, strength compared to your bodyweight.)\r\n\r\nThis program is for men who like to enjoy life. What’s the point in looking good if your life revolves around your training and diet? Answer: There is no point. It’s a complete waste. In fact, for most people reading this program, they're going to be spending less time in the gym and more time enjoying life. Sorry, gym bros.\r\n\r\nThis program is for men with patience. You'll have to live with the fact that you won't be gaining 5-10 pounds of muscle per month. The only way to do that is to either be regaining muscle previously lost or using copious amounts of anabolic steroids. We aren't about that stuff here. Plus, those that try to pack on muscle very quickly end up gaining a whole bunch of fat and ultimately ruin their physiques.\r\n\r\nBeginner and intermediate lifters can gain a maximum of 2-3 pounds of muscle per month. While this might sound slow, it’s really not. Most people need to gain 15-20 pounds of muscle max to achieve the muscularity of the Kinobody Greek God physique. This takes six months to a year to achieve.\r\n\r\nWorking out is something that I want you to continue for life. If you could build a jacked physique in two to three months, then there would be a lot more muscular guys (and gals) walking around.\r\n\r\nThat said, most guys actually think they need to gain 30-40 pounds of muscle to look impressive. This is most definitely not the case. Some people trying to build muscle tend to overeat as well as do lots of squats and deadlifts. This leads to excess fat gain and excess lower body mass. If these people were only to gain 15-20 pounds of muscle, their physiques wouldn’t change a whole lot. However, when you focus on gaining pure muscle and adding that muscle to the right places in the right amounts, then 15-20 pounds looks incredible!\r\n\r\nThat's what we're trying to accomplish here. We want to get the minimum effective amount of muscle gain and fat loss to achieve a badass physique. If this sounds great to you, let's keep on going!"

    "title": "The Ultimate Kinobody Physique",
    "content": "Over the years working out and transforming my body, people have always asked me why I work out.\r\n\r\nI tell them, “I workout because, as far as I’m concerned, I only have one body and I want it to be as healthy, fit and powerful as possible. So tell me, why don’t you workout? What’s stopping you from making the small investment that is working out and taking care of yourself that will pay off big time?”\r\n\r\nAs a child I always found it incredible that you determine how your body looks, feels and functions.\r\n\r\nWorking out a few times per week and taking care of yourself is a small price to pay for a physique that feels and looks amazing and performs well. Don’t you think?\r\n\r\n\r\nRelative Strength: The Key to the Ultimate Lean and Muscular Physique\r\nWhat's more impressive: A 220-pound guy that benches 315 pounds, or a 175-pound guy that benches 315?\r\n\r\nThe 175-pound guy is much more impressive, of course. This is because he's much lighter yet has the same strength as the bigger guy. Therefore, the lighter guy must have a higher percentage of lean body mass (i.e., low body fat) and the muscle he does have is going to be much more dense and powerful.\r\n\r\nRelative strength is the key to building the perfect physique.\r\n\r\nGet as strong as possible relative to your bodyweight. This will ensure you have a good amount of muscle and very little body fat.\r\n\r\nWhen your strength-to-weight ratio increases, you'll have a good indicator that you gained muscle, lost fat or both.\r\n\r\nEvery workout should be constructed to maximize strength gains. This is the long-term approach.\r\n\r\nFrom my experience, people get way too caught up in hitting their muscles from different angles, feeling the burn, and using high-fatigue methods such as drop-sets and supersets. These methods have their place but should never replace heavy lifting. One thing remains true: To build muscle, you need to lift heavier and heavier weights over time.\r\n\r\nWant to build muscle? Build strength! Want a big chest? Work your way up to 225-pound incline barbell bench press for five reps.\r\n\r\nWant a big back? Work up to chinups with 90 pounds attached for five reps.\r\n\r\nYou will never see someone lacking in the muscle department that can do both those tasks. That I can guarantee.\r\n\r\nWhat you WILL see is someone complaining about his flat chest whose workout routine consists of multiple different chest exercises, all performed to failure with supersets and drop-sets mixed in. Sounds exhausting. Their bench press probably hasn’t improved since the first time they benched 185 pounds. Instead, they should focus on improving strength instead of causing fatigue. Muscle follows strength.\r\n\r\nWant to improve muscular endurance? Build strength! I can’t stress how important gaining strength is for improving performance. Building strength is an effective way to improve muscular endurance. For example, who do you think can do more reps with 150 pounds on the bench press: someone who benches 200 pounds or someone who benches 300? Definitely the 300-pound lifter.\r\n\r\nWant to increase power? Build strength! Who do you think can launch their body up over a wall with more power, a guy who can do pullups with 100 pounds attached or a guy who can only do pullups with no weight attached? Obviously, it's the first guy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWant to look awesome? Build relative strength! Building strength relative to your bodyweight is the key to the ultimate physique, one that is lean, powerful and functional. The key to gaining relative strength is to focus on building as much strength as possible while keeping body fat to an absolute minimum. This training program is designed to generate strength gains and the nutrition protocol is designed to keep fat to a minimum and support muscle growth.\r\n\r\nThe combination of the two results in incredible relative strength.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to Build Super Strength and Dense Muscle\r\n\r\nFirst thing's first, there are two different forms of muscle growth: myofibrillar hypertrophy and sarcoplasmic hypertrophy.\r\n\r\nMyofibrillar hypertrophy is the growth of your muscle fibers and is trigged by lifting heavy weights for low reps (three to eight) with long rest periods. Training for myofibrillar hypertrophy builds hard, dense-looking muscle that will be highly useful since it's accompanied by large strength increases.\r\n\r\nSafe to say, we're going to be focusing on this type of muscle growth.\r\n\r\nSarcoplasmic hypertrophy is the growth of the fluid within your muscle cells and is trigged by high-volume lifting with sub-maximal weights and short rest periods.\r\n\r\nSarcoplasmic hypertrophy only accounts for about 25 percent of potential muscle growth. Think of it as the icing on the cake. It doesn’t take much to trigger this additional muscle growth but it will allow you to walk around with five to eight more pounds of muscle.\r\n\r\nThis type of training is fun to do because it delivers a great muscle pump. Unfortunately, most people get distracted by this type of training and neglect what really matters - building strength. Therefore, this type of lifting will only be a small component of the workout program."

    "title": "Revamping Your Training",
    "content": "With this strength training program, we'll be diligently tracking five different exercises that directly contribute to the aesthetic Greek God physique. These key movements are our \"indicator exercises,\" and they'll be our way to ensure that we're making consistent progress.\r\n\r\nAs you become stronger with these key movements, your body will transform. Your chest, shoulders, arms and back will begin to fill out as you drop fat and gain muscle. You'll move closer to a strong, V-shaped torso, a masculine, square chest, rock-hard shoulders and dense arms.\r\n\r\nBy tracking your six indicator exercises, you'll have visual proof of the effectiveness of your workout routine. Most people judge their routine based on how tough it is and how sore it makes them. This is an ineffective way to track progress and often misleading.\r\n\r\nThe effectiveness of your training is directly related to the progress on these five exercises. By accepting that, this training program will become 10 times more efficient. Direct your efforts on what will make you stronger and muscular, and divert your attention away from all other distractions.\r\n\r\nEvery exercise, every set, every rep has a purpose.\r\n\r\nKinobody Indicator Exercises\r\n\r\n1 - Incline Barbell Bench Press\r\n\r\nThere is nothing wrong with the regular flat bench barbell press. It's a terrific exercise at building the whole pectoral region (if done properly).\r\n\r\nThat said, I feel most people benefit more from the incline version, which develops the upper pecs more effectively. In addition, in most athletic pressing movements the arms push forward at a slightly upward angle, as opposed to directly straight out. An example of this would be pushing a car or throwing a punch.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, the incline press might be more relevant from a functional standpoint.\r\n\r\n\r\n2 - Standing Shoulder Press\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is my go-to exercise for shoulder development and true strength. This exercise also contributes to the square chest look by filling in the top area of the chest, just below the collarbone. In addition, standing presses will work the triceps hard.\r\n\r\nI recommend avoiding seated shoulder presses with the elbows flared out to the side. This is a very unnatural position for the shoulders and over time it could cause pain and injury.\r\n\r\nBy performing standing shoulder presses, your core will be engaged to keep your lower body steady, making it a wonderful compound movement that develops not only your upper body, but your core too.\r\n\r\n3 - Weighted Chinups\r\n\r\n\r\nChinups have developed my back so well that I’ve actually avoided doing any additional work for my LATs. In addition, chinups hit the biceps hard. LAT pulldowns and all the various rows don’t even come close to the effectiveness of weighted chinups.\r\n\r\nWith chinups, you can’t cheat and use momentum or a swing like you can with rows and pulldowns. Plus, chinups are a \"closed-chain exercise,\" whereas LAT pulldowns and rows are \"open-chain exercises.\" What this means is that with chinups your hands are fixed to the bar while your body is moving through space.\r\n\r\nOpen-chained exercises involve the hands moving with the entire body staying fixed in position.\r\nClosed-chain movements have greater overall muscle recruitment and lead to better muscle and strength gains.\r\n4 - Weighted Dips\r\n\r\nWeighted dips are an intense exercise that add massive amounts of pressing strength and develop muscle in the triceps and pectoral region.\r\n\r\nSome exercises are stubborn when it comes to progressing in weight. Weighted dips are not one of those exercises. They tend to go up smoothly. And, if you train this exercise properly, you should be able to add 45 pounds to this exercise in three months' time. That is a huge gain and would result in bigger triceps, a fuller chest and a stronger bench.\r\n\r\n5 - Bulgarian Split Squat or Box Squat\r\n\r\nIn the program, you have the option of doing either Bulgarian split squats or barbell box squats as your primary leg exercise. Both are effective movements that build strength and stimulate muscle growth. In fact, my favorite approach is to alternate between these two exercises. I’ll spend a couple months doing box squats and couple of months performing Bulgarian split squats. This keeps me progressing, and it also helps me avoid getting burnt out on a movement. Both of these exercises do an amazing job at developing leg strength and building the quads, hamstring and glutes.\r\n\r\nIf you aren’t able to perform squats safely, then focus predominately on the single-leg movement (Bulgarian split squats). However, focus on squats if you love doing them.\r\n\r\nFor box squats, I recommend using a box height that puts you parallel at the bottom of the squat. Pause for one second, but don’t completely rest on the box; it’s best to keep some tension. Feel welcome to perform free squats instead. However, the advantage of box squats is that it ensures proper depth on each and every rep. The pause at the bottom of the movement also increases power development. Finally, the box squat does an amazing job at teaching proper squatting mechanics: sitting back, chest up and weight in the heel of the foot.\r\n\r\n6 - Romanian Deadlift (Barbell or Dumbbell)\r\n\r\nThe Romanian deadlift is my favorite deadlift variation. It does an amazing job at developing your posterior chain -- hamstrings, glutes and low back. This deadlift variation is performed by using as much hip drive and hip hinge as possible. It's also safer than conventional deadlifts, plus it works best for higher reps (8-15 reps). Combined with Bulgarian split squats, you can build strong, powerful legs.\r\n\r\nI like to utilize both the barbell and dumbbell variations of this movement. A barbell typically allows you to lift more weight, but the dumbbell version allows for a greater range and improve on imbalances. I recommend utilizing both variations. Focus on the dumbbell version for a couple months, then switch to barbell.\r\n\r\nKinobody Assistance Movements\r\n\r\nI always include additional exercises into the workout routines I create. You could exclusively train with the five indicator exercises and build a great physique. However, it's likely that, over time, you'll have lagging muscle groups and hit strength plateaus.\r\n\r\nTo ensure complete physique development and optimal muscle gains, I include assistance movements. These are my favorites:\r\n\r\nClose-Grip Bench Press\r\n\r\n\r\nThe close-grip bench is a phenomenal pressing movement that builds a powerful chest and triceps. By using a close-grip -- with the elbows tucked into your sides -- you increase muscle recruitment in the triceps and upper chest.\r\n\r\n\r\nBarbell Curls\r\n\r\n\r\nThe barbell curl is the best exercise for developing the biceps. With this movement, you can make gradual progress in resistance.\r\n\r\nIn most biceps exercises, little strength increase is actually seen. For this reason, I use barbell curls as my main biceps exercise. You can eventually build up to barbell curls with 135 pounds for reps, increasing by 5 or even 2.5 pounds per session.\r\n\r\nIncline Dumbbell Curls\r\n\r\n\r\nIncline dumbbell curls are also very effective for the biceps because your arms are locked to the sides and your back is flat against the bench. In this position, you're unable to use any back swing; the biceps are forced to work in isolation.\r\n\r\nI like to alternate between barbell curls and incline dumbbell curls for 3-4 weeks for each. This lets you escape plateaus and keeps your biceps guessing.\r\n\r\n\r\nSkull Crushers\r\n\r\n\r\nSkull crushers hit the triceps like crazy and allow for regular loading in weight. For this reason, skull crushers should be your main triceps movement.\r\n\r\nAs with barbell curls, you can build up to 135 pounds for several reps. This is a killer exercise and will translate to better pushing strength, specifically in the lockout position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRope Extensions\r\n\r\n\r\nRope triceps pushdowns (a.k.a. rope extensions) are another great triceps exercise. This movement is better suited for higher reps, less weight and short rest periods. For that reason, I like to use them for Kino rep training and rest-pause training (which we will get into in a later section).\r\n\r\nLateral Raises\r\n\r\n\r\nTo ensure solid shoulder development, I always include lateral raises in my workout programs. The medial head of the deltoid never gets fully worked with shoulder pressing. Most of the stress for shoulder pressing is placed on the anterior head. For this reason, the medial head can slightly lag behind in overall growth. Therefore, lateral raises should be incorporated to ensure even muscle growth.\r\n\r\nIn addition, by adequately building the medial head of the shoulder, you'll contribute to the V-shaped frame that we're looking for.\r\n\r\n\r\nBent-Over Flyes\r\n\r\n\r\nStrong rear deltoids will help keep your shoulders balanced and healthy. This will keep you injury-free from heavy pressing movements. Well-developed rear deltoids will complete the shoulders, giving them a full, rounded appearance. However, make sure you have correct form with these. Your rear deltoids are rarely utilized in normal motions and could be very weak starting out. Don't try for a heavy weight, or you might get injured in the middle of your back, putting you out of commission for weeks.\r\n\r\nThis is the last exercise to create the full, capped shoulders that scream power and strength.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne-Legged Squats (a.k.a. Pistols)\r\n\r\n\r\nPistol squats are an unbelievable exercise that I regularly incorporate into my routine.\r\n\r\nThe benefits of mastering the pistol squat are enormous. The pistol requires great balance, leg strength, flexibility and coordination. For most people, building up to 6-10 reps per leg -- slow and controlled -- is enough for adequate leg strength and development.\r\n\r\nYou can perform this exercise holding a weight in your hands to increase the difficulty. Another option is to perform jumping pistol squats, where you explode up from the bottom position into a single leg jump. If you can get to this level, your legs will be looking the part.\r\n\r\nElevated Single-Leg Calf Raises\r\n\r\n\r\nI feel it's important to do some direct lower leg training. Small calves create the illusion of chicken legs, which deters us from our goal. By training your calves and keeping them around the same size as your upper arm, you'll help yourself with balance and proportion.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFor chinups and dips, you need a belt that A) you can attach additional weight in the form of barbell plates to, and B) doesn't bunch you up and have you feeling uncomfortable.\r\n\r\nThat's where the Kino Belt comes in. The belt feels amazing, even with multiple 45-pound plates attached in the front. It distributes weight in an ideal way and allows you to focus on what's most important -- the reps."

    "title": "Reverse Pyramid Training:",
    "content": "Maximizing Muscle and Strength Gains\r\nReverse pyramid training is by far the most effective training style I've ever used to build both muscle and strength.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, few people employ this very simple technique. In fact, most people train in the exact opposite way, by grabbing a weight and pumping out 12-15 reps. After a brief rest, they'll add weight and pump out another 10-12 reps. They repeat this process until they hit a weight that causes them to hit failure in the 5-8 rep range.\r\n\r\nThe problem with this progression strategy is that they become fatigued for their heaviest set. As a result, they end up using a weight that's lighter than their true 5-8 rep max. Because they're lifting below their true potential, they never promote optimal strength and muscle gains.\r\n\r\nI recommend flipping the script and performing your heaviest set first, while you are completely fresh.\r\n\r\nYour heavy set is the most productive set. It has the greatest capacity to trigger maximum strength and muscle gains. However, in order to get the maximum training effect, it's essential to begin with the heaviest set.\r\n\r\nAfter performing your heavy set -- and scoring a nice personal record in the process -- you can follow it up with a few more sets of gradually reduced weight loads. The subsequent sets will be less demanding on your neural system, since you'll be lifting lighter loads.\r\n\r\nThis is crucial because we don’t want to overtax our nervous systems. The purpose of these extra sets is to simply provide more volume to the working muscles. This will encourage optimal muscle gains.\r\n\r\nNow, here's where the magic of reverse pyramid training comes in...\r\n\r\nYou'll notice that your heavy set will make your subsequent sets feel lighter. The heavy set induces a high degree of central nervous system stimulation, resulting in greater motor unit recruitment and force, which can last for several minutes. As a result, you get more efficient muscle fiber recruitment with lighter weights after your heavy set.\r\n\r\nSince you get more muscle fiber activation in your lighter sets, you'll be stimulating hypertrophy (a.k.a. muscle growth). This is because with loads below 80-85 percent of your one-rep max (1RM), many of your muscle fibers don’t get activated until the last few reps.\r\n\r\nWith reverse pyramid training, you can get those muscle fibers to come into play from the very first rep. This is a huge deal when it comes to maximizing muscle growth.\r\n\r\nWarming Up For Your Heavy Set\r\n\r\nWe can’t jump right into our heavy set or injury will be inevitable. For that reason, I recommend a specific warmup.\r\n\r\nThe best way to prepare for your heavy set -- while avoiding fatigue -- is to perform two or three buildup sets for only one to five reps.\r\n\r\nI usually recommend using a weight that is 60 percent of your working-set weight for five reps, then 75 percent of your working set weight for three reps and then 90 percent of your work set weight for one rep.\r\n\r\nYou should rest around two minutes between these buildup sets and a full three minutes before doing your first working set.\r\n\r\nThe warmup sets are only necessary for the first exercise of any given workout. After that, you should be ready to jump right into your working sets for all remaining exercises.\r\n\r\nThat being said, you should judge how you feel. If you think you need a couple buildup sets, then take them. (Better that than risk injury.)\r\n\r\nHere's an example of three buildup sets for a 225-pound bench press:\r\n\r\n135 pounds x 5 reps (60 percent)\r\n170 pounds x 3 reps (75 percent)\r\n200 pounds x 1 reps (90 percent)\r\nReverse Pyramid Training Specifics\r\n\r\nGenerally, your heavy set should be performed with a weight that allows you to perform between 4-8 reps with maximum effort (stopping one rep shy of failure).\r\n\r\nAfter performing your first set, you should reduce the weight by about 10 percent and then perform your second set, striving for one or two more reps.\r\n\r\nIf you're doing three sets, then you'll reduce the weight by another 10 percent and shoot for an additional one to two reps.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n225 pounds x 5 reps (heavy set, max effort; rest three minutes)\r\n205 pounds x 6 reps (rest three minutes)\r\n185 pounds x 8 reps (rest three minutes)\r\nYou should take at least three minutes rest between these sets for maximum recovery and lifting performance. Rushing through these sets will drastically reduce your strength capabilities.\r\n\r\nThat's all she wrote on reverse pyramid training! This will be the focal point of the training protocol, so get familiar with this type of set/rep/load structure and learn how to make progress by doing your heaviest set first."

    "title": "Kino Rep Training",
    "content": "In addition to reverse pyramid training, we'll also integrate Kino rep training. This is an effective training style that increases volume to spur maximum muscle growth. It involves a mix of intensity (weight lifted), volume (total reps performed) and your strength progression. \r\n\r\nCombining heavy, intense reverse pyramid training with Kino rep training will produce the ultimate Greek God look.\r\n\r\nWhat Is Kino Rep Training?\r\nKino rep training is a training style I designed to achieve volume gains without draining the nervous system. \r\n\r\nThis training style is performed by starting with a relatively light weight for 10-12 reps. Then, you increase the weight and perform another set of 10-12 reps. You'll increase the weight for a third set of 10-12 reps. You can continue this for up to five total sets. \r\n\r\nBy starting light, we pre-fatigue the muscles. This means we don’t have to go quite as heavy to achieve muscle failure. \r\n\r\nI sometimes use this strategy at the end of my workout, especially leg training because it helps me avoid burn out. Since the legs are big muscle groups, going really heavy via reverse pyramid training can quickly tax your nervous system.\r\n\r\nSo, think of Kino rep training as a strategic addition to the program. It’s designed to fill in the gaps. If this is the only training style you do, you'll never reach your maximum muscle potential. \r\nThat said, if you combine this with a big focus on reverse pyramid training, Kino rep training will help you gain an extra 20 percent of muscle gains, creating the perfect Greek God physique you're after.\r\n\r\nWhat’s more, this training style can be very fun. Plus, it can boost your conditioning and stamina quite a bit. I recommend resting for shorter periods of time with Kino rep training -- 60-90 seconds works best.\r\n\r\nFor example: When performing dumbbell Romanian deadlifts, I call for four sets of 10-12 reps. You may do this: \r\n\r\nDumbbell Romanian Deadlifts: 4 sets x 10-12 reps (Kino rep training) \r\n\r\n40 pounds x 12 reps\r\n50 pounds x 12 reps\r\n60 pounds x 12 reps \r\n70 pounds x 10 reps \r\nOr perhaps the exercise is face pulls for four sets of 15 reps \r\n\r\nCable Face Pulls: 4 sets x 15 reps (Kino rep training)\r\n\r\n80 pounds x 15 \r\n90 pounds x 15 \r\n100 pounds x 15\r\n110 pounds x 15 reps \r\nAnother powerful benefit to Kino rep training is it helps you build the mind-to-muscle connection. Since we’re doing higher reps and lots of light sets, you'll learn how to really feel and squeeze your muscle. This will help you gain more muscle when you do your heavy lifting sets. \r\n\r\nThis, I believe, is the best complimentary exercise strategy to use in your workout routine, other than rest-pause training.\r\n\r\nSpeak of which..."

    "title": "Rest-Pause Training",
    "content": "There's one final training style we'll use in this program, and that’s rest-pause training. I pretty much use this for shoulder exercises like lateral raises and rear deltoid flyes. There’s a reason why thousands of men who've gone through this program have some of the best shoulders on this world. \r\n\r\nRest-pause training is an effective training style to maximize muscle growth without having to lift heavy weights. It’s fast, effective and tough as hell! \r\nThe reason why lifting heavy weights for 4-8 reps works so well to gain muscle is because your body is forced to recruit all of the muscle fibers from the very first rep. \r\n\r\nIf you were to use a light weight for 10-15 reps, your body would only start using maximum muscle fiber recruitment on the last few challenging reps. \r\n\r\nWhat does this mean? It means that for heavy lifting, every single rep is incredibly productive and effective. But for light weights, it’s only the last few reps that really ignite muscle growth. \r\n\r\nWhat's the solution? Interestingly enough, if you were to limit your rest to only 10-15 seconds, your body will still be in a state of increased muscle fiber recruitment.\r\n\r\nSo the solution is to do an all out set for 12-15 reps; then, rest for 10-15 seconds and perform 4-6 reps (using the same weight). Rest 10-15 seconds and perform 4-6 reps. Rest 10-15 seconds and perform 4-6 reps.\r\n\r\nThis strategy allows you to get more effective reps that lead to better muscle growth. I’ve found rest-pause training to be most effective for shoulders (lateral raises and rear deltoid flyes). \r\n\r\nBy combining reverse pyramid training, rest-pause training and Kino rep training, we can experience optimal muscle growth and build the body of a Greek God.\r\n\r\nToo many people get stuck on one thing. That one thing, whatever it is, works until it doesn’t.\r\n\r\nI’ve found that the combination of these three training styles to be most effective, and I can’t wait for you to experience them."

    "title": "The Art of Strength Progressions",
    "content": "The key to building a great physique is to develop strength with the key lifts of the Greek God 2.0 workouts. Now, I can give you the perfect training plan and nutrition strategy, but you still won't see results if you're not dedicated to properly increasing the weight as you move through the course.\r\n\r\nPoor results occur when we plateau because we try to increase the weight too quickly. Over time, the plateau is compounded by only being able to lift the same weight for months on end, with little to no change in your physique.\r\n\r\nThis is what most people do at the gym.\r\n\r\nI’ve discovered the sweet spot to increasing strength consistently and systematically. The Kinobody philosophy works like clockwork. When you’re able to nail down the strategy for strength progressions, your physique will improve week by week.\r\n\r\nYou'll build hard, dense muscle when your strength increase by 20-50 pounds on your key exercises.\r\n\r\nI've uncovered the secret to increasing strength and stimulating muscle growth through years of research and personal experience.\r\n\r\nI call it the double progression model.\r\n\r\nThe Double Progression Model\r\n\r\nThe double progression model is when we drill down a rep range, and once we hit the top end of that range, we increase the load and decrease the reps during the next workout.\r\n\r\nI’d absolutely love it if I could tell you to just add five pounds every workout. Unfortunately, that’s just not realistic. Sure, you may be able to do it for a few weeks or maybe even a month or two. But eventually, you'll hit a plateau.\r\n\r\n(That said, there are a few exercises that you may be able to go up by five pounds every workout: squats, deadlifts and weighted dips, for instance.)\r\n\r\nThe weighted dip is literally the only upper body exercise I’ve been able to consistently up by five pounds per workout (while hitting the same reps).\r\n\r\nTo help you with the double progression model, the Greek God Program provides you with rep ranges for all of your workouts. The rep range may call for 4-5 reps. When you can do five reps, the next workout you will increase the weight by five pounds, but go back to performing four reps. The following workout, you'll use the same weight and then go for five reps. Rinse and repeat.\r\n\r\nExample of the Double Progression Model\r\n\r\nIncline Press (Set 1)\r\n\r\nWorkout 1: 200 pounds x 5 reps\r\nWorkout 2: 205 pounds x 4 reps\r\nWorkout 3: 205 pounds x 5 reps\r\nWorkout 4: 210 pounds x 4 reps\r\nWorkout 5: 210 pounds x 5 reps\r\nWorkout 6: 215 pounds x 4 reps\r\nIn about six workouts, you’re going to increase the weight by 15 pounds, which is the ideal rate for strength gains. There’s little to no benefit to increase the weight faster than this. Even if you could jump the weight up by 10 pounds in a week, you won’t even be able to realize those muscle gains. It takes time for your body to pack on muscle. So, increasing your weight on your key lifts by 10-15 pounds per month is optimal.\r\n\r\nThis example works well for heavy compound barbell exercises. Some exercises -- particularly lighter movements and dumbbell exercises -- will need to have a wider rep range.\r\n\r\nDumbbell exercises increase the weight by five pounds per hand (10 pounds total). Therefore, you need to give yourself more room to work with before increasing the weight, since your reps may drop by two or three.\r\n\r\nIn this case, you'd perform 4-6 reps, 6-8 reps or 8-10 reps (first set, second set and third set, respectively). Therefore, you’d keep the weight the same until you can hit the top end of the rep range.\r\n\r\nDumbbell Curls (Set 1)\r\n\r\nWorkout 1: 35 pounds x 4 reps\r\nWorkout 2: 35 pounds x 5 reps\r\nWorkout 3: 35 pounds x 6 reps\r\nWorkout 4: 40 pounds x 4 reps\r\nWorkout 5: 40 pounds x 5 reps\r\nWorkout 6: 40 pounds x 6 reps\r\nClosed-Chain Movements\r\n\r\nThe Greek God Program utilizes a heavy dose of weighted chinups. As well, many of the routines will incorporate weighted dips. These exercises are intense and effective for muscle development. Both are examples of closed-chain movements, which are exercises where your hands are fixed and your body moves through a certain plane.\r\n\r\nClosed-chain movements give you a neuromuscular advantage. Plus, the beauty of weighted chinups and weighted dips is that we can increase the weight by just 2.5 pounds per workout. This is accomplished by adding a 2.5 pound weight plate to your chinup belt. By adding just 2.5 pounds per workout, there’s no need to adjust the reps. You'll be able to increase by 2.5 pounds per workout for weeks on end without ever dropping your reps.\r\n\r\nWhat if I Hit a Strength Plateau?\r\n\r\nEven with an intelligent and methodical progression model, you'll still inevitably hit a plateau. If you follow this progression model perfectly, you will be adding 15 pounds per month to your key lifts. This is because we're doing a two-day workout split, alternating between Workout A and Workout B three times per week. Every month, you'll be performing every workout six times, twelve workouts total.\r\n\r\nIf you were to increase your strength every workout for a year, you would be adding 180 pounds to your lifts. In three years, you would be the strongest person in the world with incline presses of 600 pounds and doing 500-pound chinups!\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, it’s not quite that simple. But, don’t worry; the Greek God Program 2.0 provides a solution...\r\n\r\nMost people who hit a plateau completely screw up. They freak out! Their bench press stalls, so they decide to go on some crazy bench press specialization program and start bench pressing five days per week.\r\n\r\nThis is the wrong solution. If their strength increases, it’s simply due to practicing the movement so often. But usually what happens is their strength goes down.\r\n\r\nA plateau is your body giving you a signal. When you burn out on an exercise, your body is telling you to mix it up!\r\n\r\nIt wants a new challenge, a new stressor. When you repeatedly perform the same exercises and routines for months on end, you'll get stuck. Your body adapts to the predicable stimulus and stops changing.\r\n\r\nThis is how the muscle confusion principle began. People realized if they kept doing the same exercises, they would hit a plateau.\r\n\r\nSo, they went from one direction to the exact opposite direction by mixing things up every single week. This doesn’t work either because if you change things every week, it’s impossible to improve. You have literally zero way to gauge improvement if you’re always modifying your workout.\r\n\r\nThe solution isn’t to do the same thing every week for months on end. And the solution isn’t to change things up every single week.\r\n\r\nThe solution is way more methodical. It's to ride the strength wave as long as you can. When that wave knocks you off your board (your strength gets stuck), then it’s time to hop on a different wave (new exercises).\r\n\r\nChange up the routine. When I say change up the routine, I really mean change up your exercises. Or rather, rotate your exercises by performing a slightly different variation.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you’re stuck on your incline barbell bench press, you can switch to incline dumbbell bench press. If you’re stuck on weighted chinups, you can work on weighted pullups. If your standing press is stuck, you can perform a different pressing movement.\r\n\r\nIn any case, you’re essentially performing the same movement and working the same muscles, but in a different way. Both variations will support each other. The stronger you get on the barbell incline press, the stronger you'll be on incline dumbbell presses and vice versa.\r\n\r\nIn fact, for my overhead press, I like to alternate doing a couple months of overhead press, then instead of doing more shoulder-focused exercises, I’ll work on my weighted dips or more bench. This helps increase my chest size.\r\n\r\nThe Greek God 2.0 strategy makes training really, really fun. You’ll find that when you switch the routine up, you get a new sense of vigor. You get really excited to smash your next workout.\r\n\r\nI’ve used this system to achieve some pretty damn insane lifts at a bodyweight of 180-185 pounds, including a 315-pound incline bench press for two reps and shoulder pressing 120-pound dumbbells for six reps."

    "title": "Optimal Training Frequency",
    "content": "This is a huge debate topic in the fitness industry. In fact, everywhere you go you’ll likely find a different answer. Time to put it all to rest right here:\r\n\r\n\r\nLifting Days Per Week\r\n\r\nThree strength training sessions per week is the optimal training frequency for strength and muscle gains.\r\n\r\nTaking a day off from lifting between strength training sessions allows your body to recover. Also, this day of rest gives your central nervous system a chance to recharge.\r\n\r\nBy lifting only three times per week on non-consecutive days, you can hit the gym with maximum effort and productivity. You'll always be lifting near your true potential, and strength and muscle gains will be maximized.\r\n\r\nYou will be able to make the maximum rate of gains by only lifting three times per week. There is no additional benefit from training four, five, or even six times per week. It becomes very counterproductive because recovery capabilities are reduced.\r\n\r\nMuscle and Movement Frequency\r\nAfter an intense lifting session, your muscles actually recover quite quickly. There's tons of research on muscular recovery indicating that a muscle can be loaded as often as every 48 hours.\r\n\r\nBut muscle recovery is only one side of the story.\r\n\r\nWhen you lift heavy, you create lots of neural fatigue. You drain your central nervous system and your local nerves that fire a particular muscle group. When these nerves are fatigued, a given muscle group will be short of strength until it's given enough time to recover.\r\n\r\nThe CNS takes around 48 hours to recover, much like your muscles. However the local nerves may take three to four days before they are fully recharged after a heavy lifting session.\r\n\r\nFor this reason your best bet is to lift every other day or three times per week on non-consecutive days. This gives your central nervous system a chance to fully recharge before your next strength workout.\r\n\r\nIn addition, you should only hit each muscle group every four to five days to give the local nerves a chance to fully recover. The best way to do this is to split your body into two workouts.\r\n\r\nHere’s an example split: chest, shoulders, triceps (Workout A) and back, biceps, legs (Workout B).\r\n\r\nSimply alternate between these workouts three times per week. This is what it would look like:\r\n\r\nWeek 1:\r\n\r\nMonday - Workout A\r\nWednesday - Workout B\r\nFriday - Workout A\r\nWeek 2:\r\n\r\nMonday - Workout B\r\nWednesday - Workout A\r\nFriday - Workout B\r\n\r\nResting a full week before hitting the same muscle group is generally too much time for maximizing growth and strength gains. Protein synthesis returns to normal in a muscle group after a few days and your muscles' strength abilities peak four to five days after being trained. When you wait a full week, many of your muscles' positive adaptations start to return to normal during those last couple days of rest.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the minimally effective dose of training is three times per week, with the whole body split into two different workouts."

    "title": "The Greek God 2.0 Workout Program for Strength and Density",
    "content": "Duration: Six months\r\n\r\nGoal: Rapidly increase strength on key lifts for dense muscle growth.\r\n\r\nNow for the part you’ve actually been waiting for: the Greek God workout routine!\r\n\r\nThe first training routine focuses on accelerating strength gains with key lifts. We'll be training as efficiently as possible with the sole goal of rapidly increasing strength.\r\n\r\nAs we increase your incline press by 30 pounds, your chest is going to fill out nicely.\r\nWhen your weighted chinup increases by 30 pounds, your back and biceps will start to pop.\r\nAs you increase strength on your standing press and leg lifts, you’re going to experience incredible changes to your physique.\r\nRemember, the stronger you get with these key lifts, the better you will look. This routine is about to create the best strength gains of your entire life.\r\n\r\nAs outlined previously, you'll be working out three days per week, alternating between two different workouts.\r\n\r\nWorkout A is focused on chest, shoulders, triceps and abs.\r\nWorkout B is focused on back, biceps and legs.\r\nHere's how to schedule your Greek God training:\r\n\r\nWeek One: Workout A, Workout B, Workout A\r\nWeek Two: Workout B, Workout A, Workout B\r\nI recommend lifting on non-consecutive days such as Monday/Wednesday/Friday or Tuesday/Thursday/Saturday. This works best for maximum recovery, which means every single workout you'll be able to hit personal records. Your body will turn into a strength building and muscle gaining machine.\r\n\r\nPhase One: Shoulder Emphasis (8 Weeks)\r\n\r\nThe first phase will do a fantastic job building the Greek God physique by focusing on incline pressing, overhead pressing and weighted chinups. You'll build a square, masculine chest, full, rounded shoulders and a powerful back.\r\n\r\nYou'll also train the lower body with the proven amount of intensity and volume to develop proportionate and athletic legs.\r\n\r\nWorkout A (Phase One)\r\n\r\nIncline Barbell Press: 3 sets x 4-5, 6-7, 8-10 reps (reverse pyramid training)\r\nStanding Press: 3 sets x 6-8, 8-10, 8-10 reps (reverse pyramid training)\r\nTriceps Rope Pushdowns: 3 sets x 6-8, 8-10, 10-12 reps (reverse pyramid training)\r\nLateral Raises: 1 set x 12-15 reps + 3 mini-sets x 4-6 reps (rest-pause training)\r\nHanging Knee Raises: 3 sets x 8-12 reps (straight sets)\r\nWorkout A Notes\r\n\r\nThis routine is focused on chest, shoulders, triceps and abs.\r\n\r\nIncline Barbell Press\r\n\r\nWe start with the incline barbell press. I recommend performing a few warmup sets with progressively heavier weight.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n50 percent of your heavy set weight for 6 reps\r\n70 percent of your heavy set weight for 5 reps\r\n80 percent of your heavy set weight for 3 reps\r\nIf your goal is to do 200 pounds, you'd do 100 pounds for six reps, 140 pounds for five reps and 160 pounds for three reps. This progression is designed to warm you up without inducing fatigue.\r\n\r\nIncline Press\r\n\r\nPerform your heaviest set for 4-5 reps. If you achieve the full five reps, remember to increase the weight the next workout and go for four reps.\r\nAfter resting for three minutes, drop the weight by 10 percent and go for 6-7 reps. If you can perform seven reps, increase the weight the next workout.\r\nFinally, drop the weight by 10 percent again and perform 8-10 reps. When you achieve 10 reps, increase the weight on the next workout.\r\nIt’s important to note: You should be able to perform your first set with good form. But for the second and third set, try not to kill yourself. Leave a rep in the tank. (Meaning your last rep shouldn’t be all out.)\r\n\r\nAfter incline press, I recommend resting 4-5 minutes before moving on to the standing press.\r\n\r\nStanding Press\r\n\r\nBegin by using a weight you can lift for 6-8 reps. If you get eight reps, increase the weight next workout\r\nRest three minutes, drop the weight by 10 percent and go for 8-10 reps. If you get 10 reps, then increase by five pounds for the next workout\r\nFinally, drop the weight by 10 percent and perform another set of 10 reps\r\nThis should feel pretty easy. At this point of the workout, we’ve done the most effective, difficult exercises.\r\n\r\nNow it’s time to get in a little more isolation work to complete our physique.\r\n\r\nTriceps Rope Pushdowns\r\n\r\nRope pushdowns help develop the triceps.\r\n\r\nPerform your heaviest set first for 6-8 reps\r\nRest two minutes, drop the weight by 10 percent and go for 8-10 reps\r\nRest two minutes, drop the weight by 10 percent and go for 10-12 reps\r\nWhen you can do the top end of the rep range on all three sets, increase the weight the next workout.\r\n\r\nLateral Raises\r\n\r\nBegin with a weight you can do for 12-15 reps all out\r\nAfter performing the activation set (12-15 reps), you'll rest 10-15 seconds between each mini-set and perform three mini-sets of 4-6 reps\r\nWhen you can do 15 reps on your first set, followed by six reps on all mini-sets, increase the weight the next workout. This is the rest-pause training we talked about previously, and it efficiently develops shoulder mass.\r\n\r\nHanging Knee Raises\r\n\r\nFinally, finish off with three sets of hanging knee raises to your chest. If this is too easy, hold a weight between your legs.\r\n\r\nWhen you can complete 3 sets of 12 reps, increase the weight. Rest for only a minute between sets.\r\nWorkout B (Phase One)\r\n\r\nWeighted Chinups: 3 sets x 4, 6, 8 reps (reverse pyramid training)\r\nIncline Dumbbell Hammer Curls: 3 sets x 6-8, 6-8, 8-10 reps (reverse pyramid training)\r\nBulgarian Split Squats: 4 sets x 6-8 reps (Kino rep training)\r\nDumbbell Romanian Deadlifts: 4 sets x 10-12 reps (Kino rep training)\r\nFace Pulls: 4 sets x 12-15 reps (Kino rep training)\r\nWorkout B Notes\r\n\r\nWorkout B is focused on back, biceps and legs.\r\n\r\nWeighted Chinups\r\n\r\nI recommend performing two warmup sets with progressively heavier weight.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\nBodyweight for 5 reps\r\nHalf of your heavy set weight for 3 reps\r\nIf you can do 40-pound chinups, then warmup with bodyweight for five reps and then 20 pounds for three reps.\r\n\r\nFor weighted chin ups:\r\n\r\nDo your heaviest set for 4 reps and rest three minutes\r\nDrop the weight by about 20-30 pounds, perform 6 reps and rest three minutes\r\nDrop the weight by about 20-30 pounds and perform 8 reps\r\nIncrease the weight by 2.5 pounds on all sets the next workout\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n40 pounds for 4 reps\r\n20 pounds for 6 reps\r\nBodyweight for 8 reps\r\nIf you can’t do weighted chinups, just do three sets at bodyweight. If you can’t do bodyweight chinups, substitute LAT pulldowns for three sets (6-8, 8-10, 10-12 reps) until you can rep out your bodyweight.\r\n\r\nIncline Dumbbell Hammer Curls\r\n\r\nNext we'll be doing incline dumbbell hammer curls.\r\n\r\nPerform your heaviest set first for 6-8 reps and rest two minutes\r\nDrop the weight by 5 pounds per dumbbell, perform another set of 6-8 reps, and rest two minutes\r\nDrop the weight by 5 pounds each dumbbell and perform your final set for 8-10 reps\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n40 pounds for 6 reps\r\n35 pounds for 7 reps\r\n30 pounds for 10 reps\r\nWhen you can do the top end of the rep range on all three sets, increase the weight by 5 pounds during the next workout.\r\n\r\nBulgarian Split Squats\r\n\r\nNow, we get into some leg training. Bulgarian split squats are a powerful exercise that develop leg strength and muscle. Perform Bulgarian split squats Kino Rep Training-style by beginning with light weights and increasing the load with each set (resting for two minutes between sets). Below is my recommended starting point that you can adjust according to your ability:\r\n\r\nSet 1: 10 pounds per hand for 6-8 reps\r\nSet 2: 20 pounds per hand for 6-8 reps\r\nSet 3: 30 pounds per hand for 6-8 reps\r\nSet 4: 40 pounds per hand for 6-8 reps\r\nWhen you can do all four sets for eight reps, increase the weight by 5 pounds per hand for all sets. If you go too heavy and your third set is your max, simply perform that same weight for your fourth set.\r\n\r\nEventually, you'll build up to\r\n\r\nSet 1: 40 pounds for 8 reps\r\nSet 2: 50 pounds for 8 reps\r\nSet 3: 60 pounds for 8 reps\r\nSet 4: 70 pounds for 8 reps\r\nWhen you've developed weight loads at this level, your legs will be athletic and well-developed.\r\n\r\nDumbbell Romanian Deadlifts\r\n\r\nNext, you've got dumbbell Romanian deadlifts for four sets of 10-12 (Kino rep training-style). I recommend starting with:\r\n\r\nSet 1: 30 pounds for 12 reps\r\nSet 2: 40 pounds for 12 reps\r\nSet 3: 50 pounds for 12 reps\r\nSet 4: 60 pounds for 12 reps\r\nThis may seem easy, but it’s a remarkable workout. When you can do all four sets for 12 reps, increase by 5 pounds per dumbbell on each set.\r\n\r\nWhen you can build up to 60 pounds for 12 reps, 70 pounds for 12 reps, 80 pounds for 12 reps and 90 pounds for 12 reps, you'll have a solid posterior chain and thick forearms.\r\n\r\nFace Pulls\r\n\r\nFinally, you finish off by hitting the rear deltoids and middle traps. This is best accomplished with a face pull. We will be doing this Kino rep training-style.\r\n\r\nStart with a light load for 12-15 reps\r\nIncrease the weight each set for 4 total sets\r\nWhen you can do all four sets for 15 reps, increase the weight next workout.\r\n\r\nPhase Two: Chest Emphasis (8 Weeks)\r\n\r\nBy this point of the Greek God Program 2.0, you should be seeing significant, impressive gains. In fact, I bet dollars to donuts that your incline press and weighted chinup has improved massively. By phase two, most of our clients are up 20, 30, even 40 pounds on their lifts. This is freaking unreal!\r\n\r\nNow, it’s time to keep improving.\r\n\r\nPhase two of the Greek God Program 2.0 incorporates a few classic exercises into the rotation, including a focus on the weighted dip instead of the overhead press. This will give you a mental break from intense overhead press, and you'll experience dramatic chest gains with the weighted dip. This routine will fill out your chest significantly.\r\n\r\nAnd don’t worry, you won’t lose any shoulder size. Your shoulders will get plenty of indirect work from dips, incline bench press, lateral raises and face pulls. Your shoulders will keep improving.\r\n\r\nIf you're unable to perform dips, substitute with a barbell bench press instead.\r\n\r\nWorkout A (Phase Two)\r\n\r\nIncline Dumbbell Press: 3 sets x 6-8, 8-10, 10-12 reps (reverse pyramid training)\r\nWeighted Dips: 3 sets x 6, 8, 10 reps (reverse pyramid training)\r\nOne-Arm Overhead Triceps Extensions: 3 sets x 8-10, 10-12, 12-15 reps (reverse pyramid training)\r\nDumbbell Upright Rows: 4 sets x 10-15 reps (Kino rep training)\r\nSide-to-Side Knee Ups: 3 sets x 8-12 reps per side (straight sets)\r\nWorkout A Notes\r\n\r\nIncline Dumbbell Press\r\n\r\nThe incline dumbbell press is an intense exercise that develops the upper chest.\r\n\r\nBegin with a few warmup sets at a light weight\r\nFor your first set, use a heavy weight you can perform for 6-8 reps\r\nRest three minutes, drop the weight by 10 pounds per dumbbell, and go for 8-10 reps\r\nRest three minutes, drop the weight by 10 pounds per dumbbell, and go for 10-12 reps\r\nWhen you can do the top end of the rep range for all sets, increase the weight by 5 pounds per dumbbell next workout.\r\n\r\nWeighted Dips\r\n\r\nPerform the weighted dip sets reverse pyramid-style. Reduce the weight by about 30 pounds each set. So if you begin with 60 pounds for the first set, drop to 30 pounds for the second set and bodyweight for the final set. If you're beginning with 20-30 pound weighted dips, then perform bodyweight for the second and third set.\r\n\r\nI recommend increasing the weight by 2.5-5 pounds every single workout.\r\n\r\nOne-Arm Overhead Triceps Extensions\r\n\r\nFor triceps, you'll perform one-arm overhead triceps extensions.\r\n\r\nStart with a weight you can do for 8-10 reps\r\nDrop the weight by 5 pounds and go for 10-12 reps\r\nDrop the weight by 5 pounds and go for 12-15 reps\r\nRest 2 mins between sets.\r\nDumbbell Upright Rows\r\n\r\nComplete four sets of dumbbell upright rows Kino rep training-style. I recommend starting with:\r\n\r\n20 pounds for 15 reps\r\n25 pounds for 15 reps\r\n30 pounds for 15 reps\r\n35 pounds for 12 reps\r\nWhen the weight becomes easy, increase it the next workout.\r\n\r\nSide-to-Side Knee Ups\r\n\r\nFinally, finish off the workout with side-to-side knee ups.\r\n\r\nIf the knee ups are too easy, hold a light weight between your knees.\r\n\r\nWorkout B (Phase Two)\r\n\r\nWeighted Pullups: 3 sets x 6, 8, 8 (reverse pyramid training)\r\nIncline Dumbbell Bicep Curls: 3 sets x 6-8 reps (reverse pyramid training)\r\nBox Squats: 5 sets x 6 reps (Kino rep training)\r\nSingle-Leg Romanian Deadlifts or Barbell Hip Thrusts: 3 sets x 8-12 reps (Kino rep training)\r\nSeated Bent-Over Flyes: 1 set x 12-15 reps + 3 mini-sets x 4-6 reps (rest-pause training)\r\nWorkout B Notes\r\n\r\nFor this new phase, switch to weighted pullups. Perform a couple warmup sets, then perform your heaviest set first for 6 reps. Drop the weight 20-30 pounds and perform 8 reps. Drop the weight by 20-30 pounds and perform another set of 8.\r\n\r\nIncrease the weight by 2.5 pounds per set every workout.\r\n\r\nIncline Dumbbell Bicep Curls\r\n\r\nNext, we will be doing incline hammer dumbbell curls.\r\n\r\nPerform your heaviest set first for 6-8 reps and rest two minutes\r\nDrop the weight by 5 pounds per dumbbell, perform another set of 6-8 reps and rest two minutes\r\nDrop the weight by 5 pounds and perform your final set for 6-8 reps\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n40 pounds for 6 reps\r\n35 pounds for 7 reps\r\n30 pounds for 8 reps\r\nWhen you can do the top end of the rep range on all three sets, increase the weight by 5 pounds the next workout.\r\n\r\nBarbell Box Squat\r\n\r\nNow, you go into some leg training. Start with barbell box squats to parallel. Perform five sets of six reps per set, increasing the load each set. Rest two minutes between sets.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n135 pounds for 6 reps\r\n165 pounds for 6 reps\r\n195 pound for 6 reps\r\n225 pounds for 6 reps\r\n255 pounds for 6 reps\r\nIf the weight is too heavy by your fourth or fifth set, simply stay at that weight. Increase the load each workout by five pounds.\r\n\r\nSingle-Leg Romanian Deadlift\r\n\r\nNext, do single-leg Romanian deadlifts. This is a great exercise to develop your balance, knee stability and to build your hamstrings and glutes. Romanian deadlifts also pair nicely with box squats.\r\n\r\n(Substitute with hip thrusts, if you prefer.)\r\n\r\nPerform 8-12 reps per leg. Start with a light weight and increase the load every set. When you can do three sets of 12 reps, increase the weight the next workout. Rest two minutes between sets.\r\n\r\nSeated Bent-Over Flyes\r\n\r\nFinally, finish off with rest-pause-style seated bent-over flyes. Perform a weight you can do for 12-15 reps. Rest 10-15 seconds between each mini-set and with the same weight perform three mini-sets of 4-6 reps. When you can do 15 reps and three sets of six reps, increase the weight next workout.\r\n\r\nPhase Three (Final 8 weeks)\r\n\r\nFor the final eight weeks of strength and density, you'll return to the routine in phase one. The reason is to keep increasing your key lifts (barbell incline press, standing press and weighted chinup).\r\n\r\nYou'll notice that, after doing phase two and different exercises, you feel strong and invigorated, and you'll progress on the key movements quickly.\r\n\r\nBy the end of these eight weeks, your physique will be marbled and shredded. In fact, you should be about 50-60 pounds stronger across the board. Your body will be infinitely stronger, harder and more developed.\r\n\r\nNow, of course, this is when both your commitment and the Greek God Program 2.0 begins to really pay dividends. In the next module, we'll drill down into more advanced training strategies to supercharge muscle growth from all that strength you’ve been building. But first, give yourself some huge props for finishing the first six months of the Greek God Program 2.0!\r\n\r\nWorkout A (Phase Three)\r\n\r\nIncline Barbell Press: 3 sets x 4-5, 6-7, 8-10 reps (reverse pyramid training)\r\nStanding Press: 3 sets x 6-8, 8-10, 8-10 reps (reverse pyramid training)\r\nTriceps Rope Pushdowns: 3 sets x 6-8, 8-10, 10-12 reps (reverse pyramid training)\r\nLateral Raises: 1 set x 12-15 reps + 3 mini-sets x 4-6 reps (rest-pause training)\r\nHanging Knee Raises: 3 sets x 8-12 reps (straight sets)\r\nWorkout B (Phase Three)\r\n\r\nWeighted Chinups: 3 sets x 4, 6, 8 reps (reverse pyramid training)\r\nIncline Dumbbell Hammer Curls: 3 sets x 6-8, 6-8, 8-10 reps (reverse pyramid training)\r\nBulgarian Split Squats: 4 sets x 6-8 reps (Kino rep training)\r\nDumbbell Romanian Deadlifts: 4 sets x 10-12 reps (Kino rep training)\r\nFace Pulls: 4 sets x 12-15 reps (Kino rep training)\r\nFinal Thoughts on Kinobody's Strength and Density Workout\r\n\r\nIt’s absolutely essential you track and record these workouts. You can do so by bringing a notebook to the gym. Or you can record it in your phone on your Notes app or a tracking app. I personally just use Notes.\r\n\r\nBonus Routine\r\n\r\nFor those of you who want to grow their legs like crazy or have underdeveloped legs and you want to have them catch up, I've created the ideal workout for you.\r\n\r\nThis training schedule involves a hefty amount of deadlifts. Deadlifts will not only build up your legs into tree trunks, they'll also create an impressive lower back and core. It's a tremendous all-around exercise that can improve your entire physique...fast.\r\n\r\nFor the full workout schedule, check out the bonus chapter for leg strength and density."

    "title": "MEGA Training (12-Week Program)",
    "content": "Now, it’s time to talk about MEGA training, or minimum effort growth acceleration.\r\n\r\nThis is a strategy I developed to maximize muscle growth. It's pretty simple. We'll be adding a couple bonus exercises every workout that are designed to get in more volume. MEGA training increases sarcoplasmic hypertrophy towards your key muscle groups. The icing on the cake, sarcoplasmic hypertrophy is muscle growth due to more fluid in the muscle tissue. It’s best achieved with higher reps and shorter rest periods.\r\n\r\nI don’t recommend MEGA training year-round. I find strength and density work to be the best at producing long-term strength and muscle gains. MEGA training creates faster muscle growth in bursts. If you do it too long, it will stop working effectively, as your body will get used to the higher volume. Strength gains can start to slow down.\r\n\r\nMy favorite strategy is to do a 2:1 ratio of strength and density and MEGA training. This, of course, is the case with the two-day split. The two-day split is pretty damn brutal with MEGA training, since you’re going to be doing pretty big workouts with a high degree of intensity.\r\n\r\nI recommend doing about six months of strength and density, followed by three months of MEGA training. That would make up the first round. If you want to repeat this strategy, simply do four months of strength and density, followed by two months of MEGA training. This would keep your training routine more fun and engaging. The longer you’ve been training, the more frequently you want to change things up.\r\n\r\nMEGA Training Notes\r\n\r\nBe careful not to push every set to failure with MEGA training. You'll quickly burn out. It’s best to keep a rep in the tank on your sets. If you can get nine reps, stop at eight. Avoid grinding out your sets. If you have to kill yourself to get another rep, don’t go for it. By keeping a rep in the tank, you'll maintain greater strength and performance throughout the entire workout, which allows for better muscle gains.\r\n\r\nI also recommend utilizing Kinobody's Superhero Stack during this program. The superhero stack includes Kino Octane (pre workout), Kino Aminos (branched-chain amino acids) and Kino Gains (creatine and L-carnitine). Supplementing your diet with these nutrients will produce the absolute best results possible.\r\n\r\nPhase One: Six Weeks\r\n\r\nWorkout A\r\n\r\nIncline Dumbbell Bench Press: 3 sets x 4-6, 6-8, 8-10 reps (reverse pyramid training)\r\nClose Grip Bench Press: 3 sets x 6-8, 8-10, 10-12 (reverse pyramid training)\r\nCable Cross-Overs: 4 sets x 10-12 reps (Kino rep training)\r\nLateral Raises: 1 set x 12-15 reps + 3 mini-sets x 4-6 reps (rest-pause training)\r\nTriceps Pushdowns: 4 sets x 10-12 reps (Kino rep training)\r\n(Optional Bonus Movement) Hanging Knee Raises: 3 sets x 8-12 reps (straight sets)\r\nWorkout B\r\n\r\nWeighted Pullups: 3 sets x 6, 8, 8 reps (reverse pyramid training)\r\nIncline Hammer Dumbbell Curls: 3 sets x 6-8 reps (reverse pyramid training)\r\nBox Squats: 4 sets x 6-8 reps (Kino rep training)\r\nHip Thrusts: 4 sets x 8-10 reps (Kino rep training)\r\nCable Rows: 4 sets x 10-12 reps (Kino rep training)\r\nMachine Curls: 4 sets x 10-12 reps (Kino rep training)\r\n(Optional Bonus Movement) Shrugs: 4 sets x 10-12 reps (Kino rep training)\r\nPhase Two: Six Weeks\r\n\r\nWorkout A\r\n\r\nIncline Barbell Bench Press: 3 sets x 4-6, 6-8, 8-10 reps (reverse pyramid training)\r\nStanding Barbell Press: 3 sets x 6-8, 8-10, 10-12 reps (reverse pyramid training)\r\nMachine Bench Press: 4 sets x 10-12 reps (Kino rep training)\r\nDumbbell Overhead Triceps Extensions: 4 sets x 10-12 reps (Kino rep training)\r\nUpright Rows: 4 sets x 12-15 reps (Kino rep training)\r\nHanging Knee Raises: 3 sets x 8-12 reps (straight sets)\r\nWorkout B\r\n\r\nWeighted Chinups: 3 sets x 4, 6, 8 reps (reverse pyramid training)\r\nIncline Dumbbell Hammer Curls: 3 sets x 6-8 reps (reverse pyramid training)\r\nBulgarian Split Squats: 4 sets x 6-8 reps (Kino rep training)\r\nDumbbell Romanian Deadlift: 4 sets x 10-12 reps (Kino rep training)\r\nMachine Rows: 4 sets x 10-12 reps (Kino rep training)\r\nCable Rope Curls: 4 sets x 10-12 reps (Kino rep training)"

    "content": "For rapid muscle growth, I recommend using specialization routines. This is how you can force muscle growth at a quicker rate. You simply can’t increase volume on all of your muscle groups. Doing so would equal overtraining and strength regression.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the solution is to pick one muscle group on each workout day and add more volume to it.\r\n\r\n(Note: Stick with the same specialization workouts for six weeks before changing.)\r\n\r\nChest Specialization\r\n\r\n\r\nWorkout A: Chest, Shoulders, Triceps\r\n\r\nIncline Bench Press: 5 sets x 5, 6, 8, 8, 8 reps (reverse pyramid training)\r\nFlat Bench Press: 3 sets x 6, 8, 10 reps (reverse pyramid training)\r\nLateral Raises: 3 sets x 8-12 reps\r\nSkull Crushers: 3 sets x 6-10 reps\r\n\r\nNotes on the Workout\r\n\r\n\r\nFor this workout, you'll be adding two additional sets to incline bench press. This extra volume will speed up muscle growth. Use the same weight for the last three sets. If you're unable to get the full eight reps, that’s fine - do what you can.\r\n\r\nIn addition, you'll be performing flat bench press for your second exercise. This is a great overall mass builder to the chest, especially in conjunction with incline bench as well. For variance, do incline with the barbell and flat bench with dumbbells.\r\n\r\n\r\nShoulder Specialization\r\n\r\nWorkout A: Chest, Shoulders, Triceps\r\n\r\n\r\nStanding Shoulder Press: 5 sets x 5, 6, 8, 8, 8 (reverse pyramid training)\r\nWeighted Dips or Close-Grip Bench: 3 sets x 5, 6, 8 (reverse pyramid training)\r\nLateral Raises: 3 sets x 8-12 reps\r\nSkull Crushers: 3 sets x 8-12 reps\r\n\r\nNotes on the Workout\r\n\r\n\r\nFor this workout, you'll be adding two additional sets to standing shoulder press. For standing press, use the same weight for the last three sets.\r\n\r\n\r\nTriceps Specialization\r\n\r\nWorkout A: Chest, Shoulders, Triceps\r\n\r\n\r\nIncline Bench Press: 3 sets x 5, 6, 8 (reverse pyramid training)\r\nWeighted Dips or Close-Grip Bench: 3 sets x 6, 8, 10 reps (reverse pyramid training)\r\nLateral Raises: 3 sets x 8-12 reps\r\nSkull Crushers: 3 sets x 6-10 reps\r\nRope Extensions: 2 sets x 10-12 reps\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes on the Workout\r\n\r\nFor this workout, you'll add an extra triceps exercise to the end of the workout. Keep the rest between 60-90 seconds on rope extensions.\r\n\r\nBack Specialization\r\n\r\nWorkout B: Back, Biceps, Traps, Legs\r\n\r\nWeighted Pullups: 5 sets x 5, 6, 8, 8, 8 (reverse pyramid training)\r\nHang Cleans or Sumo Deadlifts: 3 sets x 5, 6, 8 (reverse pyramid training)\r\nBent-Over Flyes: 3 sets x 8-12 reps\r\nBarbell Curls: 3 sets x 6-10 reps\r\n\r\nNotes on the Workout\r\n\r\n\r\nFor this workout, you'll perform pullups instead of chinups.\r\n\r\nIn addition, you will be performing five sets total. If you're unable to perform at least five reps on the last three sets, you can switch over to LAT pulldown for the last few sets.\r\n\r\nBiceps Specialization\r\n\r\nWorkout B: Back, Biceps, Traps, Legs\r\n\r\n\r\nWeighted Close-Grip Chinups: 3 sets x 5, 6, 8 (reverse pyramid training)\r\nBarbell Curls: 3 sets x 6-10 reps\r\nIncline Dumbbell Curls: 2 sets x 8-12 reps\r\nBent-Over Flyes: 3 sets x 8-12 reps\r\nPistols + Calf Raises: 3 sets x 3-5 reps + 10-12 reps\r\nNotes on the Workout\r\n\r\n\r\nFor this workout, you'll add an extra biceps exercise to the end of the workout. Keep the rest between 60-90 seconds on incline dumbbell curls.\r\n\r\n\r\nLegs Specialization\r\n\r\nWorkout B: Back, Biceps, Traps, Legs\r\n\r\n\r\nSquats: 3 sets x 5, 6, 8 (reverse pyramid training)\r\nCalf Raises: 3 sets x 8-12 reps\r\nWeighted Chinups: 3 sets x 5, 6, 8 (reverse pyramid training)\r\nBent-Over Flyes: 3 sets x 8-12 reps\r\nBarbell Curls: 3 sets x 6-10 reps\r\n\r\nNotes on the Workout\r\n\r\n\r\nFor this workout, you'll be performing squats. The squat is so powerful at building leg mass that most people don’t need to use this exercise for very long.\r\n\r\nIf you have slim legs this is a good routine to use. If you don’t want to get bigger legs, then I would recommend avoiding this routine.\r\n\r\nYou should be adding 5 pounds to the bar every squat workout. This is because squats progress at a faster rate than upper body movements.\r\n\r\nIf you do not wish to perform the barbell back squat, you can perform the pistol squat instead. Perform three sets of the pistol squat, slow and controlled. If possible, use weight on your first two sets.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\nSet 1: 40 pounds x 5 reps (or Set 1: 20 pounds x 5 reps)\r\nSet 2: 20 pounds x 6 reps (or Set 2: Bodyweight x 6 reps)\r\nSet 3: Bodyweight x 8 reps (or Set 3: Bodyweight x 6 reps)"

    "title": "Greek God 2.0 Three-Day Split",
    "content": "The final protocol in the Greek God Program 2.0 is the three-day split. Instead of doing all your training over the course of two workouts (Workout A and Workout B), we'll be doing it over the course of three workouts (Workout A, Workout B and Workout C). This allows for more exercise selection and more focus on specific muscle groups.\r\n\r\nDoing the two-day split for several years, it eventually becomes pretty damn brutal, taxing your body that often. You won’t be able to continue making rapid rates of strength gains. So, it makes sense to switch to a three-day split. This will mean a slightly slower rate of strength gain, but you’ll be able to hit your key muscle groups with more volume per session. This can help you keep gaining muscle at a solid rate as a more advanced lifter.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, after doing the three-day split for three months, you can go back to the two-day split for two to three months. Mixing things up every few months allows your body to keep progressing. Of course, if you were to do the two-day split year round, you'd eventually burn out.\r\n\r\nAnother advantage of the three-day split is it allows you to work on your shoulder press completely fresh. This will help you hit more shoulder press personal records and build greater overall shoulder size and development.\r\n\r\nFinally, for the three-day split, we'll be taking your physique to the next level with some neck and traps training. Filling out your neck and traps will make you look stronger, more muscular and even more masculine. In fact, a thick neck is a sign of a more masculine man. It’s incredible how adding a little neck and trap thickness can make you look more more alpha and attractive. I’ve noticed a big difference, adding 1-1.5 inches to my neck thickness. (Of course, you don't want to overdo neck development; that's why we implement the ideal amount of training.)\r\n\r\nAll of this to say, once you start to plateau or feel the slog of two-day splits, it's time to experience the benefits of the three-day split.\r\n\r\nThe Beauty of the Three Day Split\r\nThe three-day split is incredibly powerful. In fact, most of your key muscle groups will be getting hit hard two times per week. You're hitting your chest hard on Friday. That said, your chest will be hit indirectly on Monday as well. The same goes for shoulders. Your shoulders will be hit very hard on Monday. Then on Friday, you get indirect shoulder work from incline press, bench press/dips and rear deltoid lifts. Your triceps will be getting hit hard two days a week (directly from extensions and indirectly from presses). The same goes for biceps.\r\n\r\nThe only muscle groups that will be hit only once per week are back and legs. However, from my experience this works perfectly as, typically, these muscle groups can grow very quickly. The back and legs are big muscle groups and can easily become overdeveloped. The harder muscle groups to build are the shoulders, arms and upper chest.\r\n\r\nThis three-day split is the best protocol to optimize your shoulder, upper chest and arm development while developing the perfect amount of back and leg size for the ultimate Greek God Physique.\r\n\r\nPhase One: Weeks 1-6\r\nWorkout A (Monday):\r\nStanding Barbell Press: 3 sets x 4-6, 6-8, 8-10 reps (reverse pyramid training)\r\nWeighted Chinups: 3 sets x 4, 6, 8 reps (reverse pyramid training)\r\nSeated Cable Rows: 4 sets x 10-12 reps (Kino rep training)\r\nTriceps Rope Pushdowns: 3 sets x 6-8, 8-10, 10-12 reps (reverse pyramid training)\r\nDumbbell Lateral Raises: 1 set x 12-15 reps + 3 sets x 4-6 reps (rest-pause training)\r\nWorkout B (Wednesday):\r\nBox Squats: 5 sets x 6-8 reps (Kino rep training)\r\nBarbell Walking Lunges: 2 sets x 8-10 reps per leg (Kino rep training)\r\nDumbbell Romanian Deadlifts: 3 sets x 10-15 reps (Kino rep training)\r\nMachine Calf Raises: 4 sets x 10-15 reps (Kino rep training)\r\nCable Shrugs: 3 sets x 10-15 reps (Kino rep training)\r\nNeck Extensions: 3 sets x 20-30 reps (Kino rep training)\r\nNeck Curls: 3 sets x 20-30 reps (Kino rep training)\r\nWorkout C (Friday):\r\nIncline Barbell Press: 3 sets x 4-5, 6-8, 6-8 reps (reverse pyramid training)\r\nWeighted Dips: 2 sets x 6-8, 8-10 reps (reverse pyramid training)\r\nIncline Dumbbell Curls: 4 sets x 6-8 reps (reverse pyramid training)\r\nStanding Hammer Curls: 4 sets x 8-10 reps (Kino rep training)\r\nCable Face Pulls: 1 set x 12-15 reps + 3 sets x 4-6 reps (rest-pause training)\r\nPhase Two: Weeks 7-12\r\nMonday\r\nArnold Press: 3 sets x 6-8, 8-10, 10-12 reps (reverse pyramid training)\r\nWeighted Pullups: 3 sets x 6, 8, 8 reps (reverse pyramid training)\r\nMachine Rows: 3 sets x 10-12 reps (Kino rep training)\r\nSingle-Arm Overhead Dumbbell Triceps Press: 3 sets x 8-10, 10-12, 10-12 reps (reverse pyramid training)\r\nDumbbell Upright Rows: 1 set x 12-15 reps + 3 sets x 4-6 reps (rest-pause training)\r\nWednesday\r\nSumo Deadlifts: 5 sets x 4-6 reps (Kino rep training)\r\nBulgarian Split Squats: 3 sets x 6-8 reps (Kino rep training)\r\nMachine Calf Raises: 4 sets x 10-15 reps (Kino rep training)\r\nCable Shrugs: 3 sets x 10-15 reps (Kino rep training)\r\nNeck Extensions: 3 sets x 20-30 reps (Kino rep training)\r\nNeck Curls: 3 sets x 20-30 reps (Kino rep training)\r\nFriday\r\nIncline Dumbbell Press: 3 sets x 6-8, 8-10, 10-12 reps (reverse pyramid training)\r\nBarbell Bench Press: 3 sets x 6-8, 8-10, 10-12 reps (reverse pyramid training)\r\nSeated Hammer Curls: 4 sets x 6-8 reps (reverse pyramid training)\r\nMachine Curls: 4 sets x 10-12 reps (Kino rep training)\r\nMachine Rear Deltoid Flyes: 1 set x 12-15 reps + 3 sets x 4-6 reps (rest-pause training)"

    "content": "Nutrition for building muscle is actually very simple: Eat plenty of food and include lots of protein and carbs.\r\n\r\nIf you follow this protocol and workout, you'll definitely build muscle. However, when the goal is to build muscle and keep fat gain to an absolute minimum, diet and nutrition become much more complicated.\r\n\r\nYour body can only use so many surplus calories for muscle growth and storage. Eventually, any additional calories will be stored as fat.\r\n\r\nIn order to ensure you build muscle without gaining fat you need to be diligent in tracking your food intake. Eat too few calories and muscle growth will not occur at a meaningful rate. Eat too many calories and unpleasant fat gain will occur.\r\n\r\nWe need to find the amount of weekly surplus calories you can handle before fat gain occurs. For most people, this is around 2,000 surplus calories per week. This works out to be an extra 285 calories per day.\r\n\r\nMost guys trying to build muscle aim to eat 500 calories over maintenance per day. Those extra 215 calories tend to get stored as fat. Instead of eating 285 extra calories each and every day, it’s better to place more calories on lifting days and less calories on rest days. This will lead to slightly better muscle gains since you'll be providing extra calories on days where your body is primed for muscle growth."

This is where you eat at at a calorie surplus on training days to encourage muscle growth and at a calorie deficit on rest days to encourage fat loss.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the week, you'll have eaten very close to maintenance but it's likely you'll have improved your overall body composition (more muscle and less fat).\r\n\r\nRest Days (4 times per week): -300 calories under maintenance\r\nLifting Days (3 times per week): +400 calories over maintenance\r\nWeekly calorie surplus = 0\r\n\r\nIt’s best to use a modest calorie surplus/deficit on lifting/rest days. Go too low in calories on rest days, and muscle recovery and growth will be compromised. As well, going too high in calories on training days will inevitably lead to fat spillover. Instead of building a little muscle on training days and losing a little fat on rest day you will be gaining muscle and fat on training days and losing muscle and fat on rest days.\r\n\r\nObviously, big calorie swings between lifting and rest days aren’t optimal.

    "title": "Determining Protein, Fat and Carb Intake",
    "content": "Of secondary importance to calorie intake is the makeup of those calories.\r\n\r\nThe first thing that you must do is to ensure you are consuming adequate dietary protein. Since protein is essential for muscle growth, this is the number one priority in regards to macronutrient intake. Before even worrying about how much fat and carbs to eat, you need to first determine your protein needs.\r\n\r\nMost research indicates that the maximum amount of protein needed to support muscle growth is 1.8 grams per kg (or 0.8 grams per pound) of bodyweight, but I feel consuming slightly more protein than this is beneficial. Since we need to be careful not to overeat and cause fat gain, it makes sense to eat lots of protein to stay full and satisfied. For this reason, I recommend eating one gram of protein per pound of goal bodyweight. As long as you include high protein foods in your meals, it'll be relatively easy to reach this amount. If you have trouble eating this much protein, you're welcome to include protein shakes into your diet.\r\n\r\nIf you are 160 pounds and your goal is to be 175 pounds, then aim for 175 grams of protein per day. Don’t set your protein intake more than 15 over your current weight in pounds. So if you’re 160 pounds and your goal weight is 180 pounds, then set your protein intake at a maximum of 175 grams per day. When you are within 15 pounds of your goal weight, then you can adjust your protein intake up to 180 grams.\r\n\r\nThe next macronutrient to set is fat intake. Fat should make up 20-30% of total calories. Going too low in fat will leave you hungry between meals and will make your meals bland. Plus, low-fat diets may negatively impact testosterone levels. Use 25 percent of total calories as the default for fat intake.\r\n\r\nIf you prefer to include more fat in exchange for carbs, you can adjust this number up to 30 percent. If you prefer less fat and more carbs you can adjust this number down to 20 percent.\r\n\r\nA fat intake of between 20-30 percent of total calories will leave the largest percentage of your calories to come from carbohydrates. This is an ideal scenario for building muscle. A high intake of carbohydrates will ensure that you maintain full glycogen stores in your muscles. Your body is more efficient at building muscle and being in an anabolic state when your glycogen stores are full or near full. In addition, carbs are the most efficient energy source and sufficient carbs will ensure optimal training performance.\r\n\r\nThe better and more intense your workouts are, the more muscle growth you will promote.\r\n\r\nTo calculate fat intake: Multiply calories per day by 0.25 (25 percent) and then divide that number by 9 to get grams of fat per day.\r\nTo calculate carb intake: Add together fat calories and protein calories. Subtract this number from total calories per day. This will provide you with the number of calories to consume from carbs per day. Divide this number by 4 to get carbs per day in grams."

Most people I find do best on two to four meals per day. The biggest meals should come in the evening and after training. This maximizes fat burning during the day and amplifies glycogen storage in the muscles from training. As well, big meals early in the day tend to cause tiredness. Lastly, this eating pattern tends to be the most enjoyable and satisfying.\r\n\r\nMy recommended plan is to skip breakfast, eat a moderate sized lunch, train in the afternoon, have a big dinner with plenty of carbs post-workout and then another big meal 1-2 hours before going to bed.\r\n\r\nIf you train in the evening, then it would be better to eat a moderate sized lunch, another moderate sized meal 2-3 hours before training and a big dinner post-workout.\r\n\r\nIf you train earlier in the day, then it’s best to take 10 grams of BCAAs before training, have a normal sized lunch, a big dinner and another meal 3-4 hours later (2 hours before going to bed).\r\n\r\nExample Meal Schedule\r\n\r\nWake up at 8 a.m.\r\n8 a.m. to Meal 1: Coffee and sparkling water (I prefer Fasting Fuel -- learn more here)\r\n2 p.m.: Meal 1 (protein salad or 2 percent Greek yogurt and almonds)\r\n5 p.m.: Workout\r\n6:30 p.m.: Meal 2 (animal protein and rice, potatoes or yams)\r\n10 p.m.: Meal 3 (animal protein and rice, potatoes or yams)\r\nSample Meal Plan 1:\r\n\r\nMeal 1:\r\n\r\nPlain Greek yogurt or cottage cheese\r\nHandful of almonds\r\nServing of fruit\r\nMeals 2 and 3:\r\n\r\nChicken breast\r\nBrown rice cooked in 1-2 tablespoons of coconut oil\r\nVeggies and spinach salad\r\nSample Meal Plan 2:\r\n\r\nMeal 1:\r\n\r\nSalad loaded with grilled chicken breast, sliced tomatoes, cucumbers, shredded cheese and avocado\r\nServing of fruit\r\nMeals 2 and 3:\r\n\r\nBeef (flank steak, 90 percent lean ground beef, or roast beef)\r\nPotatoes or sweet potatoes\r\nButter (for taste)\r\nVeggies and spinach salad\r\nWhat About Breakfast?\r\nI recommend skipping breakfast.\r\n\r\nI can already hear the comments: “Skip breakfast? Are you crazy?”\r\n\r\nThere's really no good reason to eat breakfast. By pushing your first meal later into the day, you force your body to burn fat for fuel, elevate growth hormone and increase insulin sensitivity in the muscles. This creates the perfect storm for building muscle and burning fat.\r\n\r\nAs long as you limit the daily fast to 16-18 hours, there will be no muscle catabolism during the fast.\r\n\r\nWhen you do eat after an extended fast, the anabolic effects of that meal will be greater. This is due to improvements in your insulin sensitivity. It leads to greater nutrition partitioning in your muscles stores.\r\n\r\nI have found that, by skipping breakfast, I've had a much easier time building muscle while maintaining leanness. That said, it's essential that you provide your body with the right amount of nutrition during the feasting window. If you're incapable getting in the appropriate amount of calories in 2-3 large meals, then fasting is probably not for you.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to workout before your first meal, then I recommend taking 10 grams of BCAAs before training. Pre-workout protein is highly beneficial at increasing protein synthesis and preventing protein breakdown."

    "content": "One of the main reasons why people fail to follow through on their workout program and nutrition plan is because of a lack of accountability. They make it extremely easy for themselves to miss workouts, half-ass it in the gym and not follow their diet regimen.\r\n\r\nThis is simply unacceptable!\r\n\r\nBy purchasing this program, you made the decision right then and there that you no longer wanted to settle for a mediocre body. You wanted to rise above and beyond and achieve an awe-striking physique. I’m talking about the level of physical development which brings with it enormous amounts of self-respect and confidence.\r\n\r\nI want you to commit to following this workout program with absolute consistency and dedication. That you will do whatever it takes to hit the gym three times per week with extraordinary effort and drive. No matter what, you will not sabotage your efforts by rationalizing skipping the gym or screwing up your diet.\r\n\r\nThe reason most people have so much difficulty following through on a workout plan is because they make up excuses for why they can’t hit the gym. They lie to themselves that it will just be this one time and that the following weeks will be perfect. The truth is that if you are going to skip a workout now then you will do so again in the future. You need to hold yourself accountable and do whatever it takes to drag yourself to the gym.\r\n\r\nI have never met anyone in my life that couldn’t find one hour to work out three times per week. If something comes up, shift things around and make it work. There's simply no excuse for not being able to work out three times per week. End of story.\r\n\r\nMaking This Plan Work\r\n\r\nTo really maximize your results on this program, it's essential that you track your strength and physique progress. By doing so, your results will improve dramatically. When you're tracking your progress, missing a workout or just going through the motions in the gym has real, substantial consequences. Tracking progress is the most effective way to keep yourself disciplined and accountable for your actions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProgress Tracking 1: Lifts\r\n\r\n\r\nEach workout, you should be recording and tracking your main lifts. Your main core lifts are incline bench press, weighted chinups, standing shoulder press, and your current leg exercise. If you follow the progression scheme correctly, you'll be adding 10-15 pounds per month to each of these lifts.\r\n\r\nBeginners will alternate adding 5 pounds to their second and third set or their first set each workout. Advanced lifters will add 5 pounds to only one of their three sets per workouts.\r\n\r\nIf you’re only capable of doing chinups for 5 reps with 15 pounds, then you could get up to 75-105 pounds for 5 reps in 6 months. If you are incline bench pressing 135 pounds for 5 reps, then in 6 months you could get up to 195-225 pounds. These are crazy leaps in strength and muscle gain! But it only works if you track your progress.\r\n\r\nCombine this with a low body fat and you will be dropping jaws.\r\n\r\n\r\nProgress Tracking 2: Weight and Waist Measurement\r\n\r\n\r\nEach week, you should be weighing yourself and measuring your waist circumference around your belly button with a normal, relaxed posture (no sucking in or flexing). If you're slowly gaining weight - about half a pound per week - and your waist is staying the same, then you know you're building pure muscle. This is great! If you're in a recomposition and staying around the same weight but your waist is becoming smaller, then you know you're gaining muscle and losing fat.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if your waist measurement is going up, you know you're overdoing it with your calorie intake. You would want to cut the calories back to eliminate fat gain.\r\n\r\nMake sure to weigh yourself the same day each week. Weigh yourself and measure your waist first thing in the morning (after using the bathroom if required). This will provide the greatest accuracy.\r\n\r\n\r\nProgress Tracking 3: Muscle Measurements\r\n\r\n\r\nEach month I recommend taking a few additional measurements to get the full picture. This will give you an idea of how exactly your body is changing. I recommend measuring the chest with relaxed posture at mid-chest level, no flexing in or sticking out the chest.\r\n\r\nI also recommend measuring your arms. The best way to measure the arms is by flexing them and measuring around the widest point, usually right in the middle of the biceps.\r\n\r\nTake this measurement first thing in the morning. If you measure after a workout, you'll notice a slightly bigger reading. This is only temporary so it doesn’t count.\r\n\r\n\r\nProgress Tracking 4: Photos\r\n\r\nA picture says a thousand words! A picture can say so much more than a number. For that reason, it's wise to take regular monthly pictures to track progress. I recommend taking pictures in the morning and in the same lighting conditions each time.\r\n\r\nHere are the pictures I recommend taking:\r\n\r\nFront pose relaxed, flexed abs and double biceps pose\r\nBack pose relaxed and double biceps pose\r\nSide pose flexed triceps and side pose flexed biceps"

    "title": "The Leg-Focused Strength and Density Bonus Routine",
    "content": "If you want to get very strong on your deadlift, I've included the heavy deadlift option.\r\n\r\nYou see, the standard Greek God Program 2.0 includes Bulgarian split squats and Romanian deadlifts (Phase One), as well as box squats and single-leg Romanian deadlifts (Phase Two). This is great -- and definitely enough -- for developing your lower body.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you want to really maximize your deadlift strength, you'll want to perform the heavy deadlift option. Now, I recommend being careful with going very heavy on deadlifts. This is where I’ve seen injuries happen. Even with the heavy deadlift option, I recommend not pushing beyond 90 percent of your maximum. \r\n\r\nThe reason is simple: Pushing too close to failure on deadlifts can be very risky. This is where you'll be grinding reps out and you may put your lower back in a vulnerable position. Plus, going too intense on your heavy deadlifts can interfere with your central nervous system recovery, which is NOT what we want.\r\n\r\nThe benefit of keeping your heavy set at about 90 percent intensity is that it allows you to execute the set with better form and a faster cadence (a.k.a. more explosive). This means it will better carry over to sports, or to your sprinting and jumping. \r\n\r\nEnter the Deadlift \r\nNow, the deadlift can be a great overall strength movement. The deadlift develops your hamstrings, glutes, low back, mid back, traps and forearms to a large degree. \r\n\r\nI prefer to do the sumo deadlift, which I feel does a greater job at building your legs and ensuring your back maintains proper positioning (i.e., no rounding). The sumo deadlift is performed by taking a wider stance. Your feet should actually be outside of your hands. \r\n\r\nIn fact, one of the top sprint coaches in the world, Barry Ross, has found the sumo deadlift to do an amazing job at carrying over to sprinting; therefore, if you want to improve your running, I suggest getting strong on your sumo deadlift.\r\n\r\nThe Heavy Deadlift Bonus Routine \r\nSo for the heavy deadlift option, you'll replace the leg exercises from the standard Workout B with the following routine: \r\n\r\nHeavy Deadlift Phase One \r\nSumo Deadlifts: 5 sets x 5 reps (Kino rep training)\r\nBulgarian Split Squats: 3 sets x 6-8 reps (Kino rep training)\r\nNotes\r\nI recommend performing the deadlifts a'la Kino rep training for five reps per set. This is where you start light and perform five reps. For each set, increase the weight. You want to increase the weight accordingly so that your last set is close to your five-rep max. Rest two to three minutes between sets. \r\n\r\nFor example, let's say you can deadlift 300 pounds for five reps. Here’s how it would look:\r\n\r\nSet 1: 135 pounds x 5 reps\r\nSet 2: 185 pounds x 5 reps\r\nSet 3: 225 pounds x 5 reps\r\nSet 4: 275 pounds x 5 reps\r\nSet 5: 300 pounds x 5 reps\r\nAs for the next week, you'd increase the weight on all sets by roughly 5 pounds: \r\n\r\nSet 1: 140 pounds x 5 reps\r\nSet 2: 190 pounds x 5 reps\r\nSet 3: 230 pounds x 5 reps\r\nSet 4: 280 pounds x 5 reps\r\nSet 5: 305 pounds x 5 reps\r\nYou would keep increasing by 5 pounds every workout until you plateau. This would be the perfect time to go back to the lighter deadlift option in the original Greek God training schedule (Bulgarian split squats and Romanian deadlifts or front squats and single-leg Romanian deadlifts).\r\n\r\nFor Bulgarian split squats, increase the weight on all three sets when you can do eight reps on each set. \r\n\r\nHeavy Deadlift Phase Two\r\nSumo Deadlifts: 5 sets x 5 reps (Kino rep training)\r\nFront Squats: 3 sets x 6-8 reps (Kino rep training)\r\nNotes\r\nFor phase two of the heavy deadlift, you'll be switching the secondary exercise to barbell front squats. The front squat is a great movement to develop your leg strength with more focus on your quads. It also does an amazing job building a rock-solid core. \r\n\r\nIt's the same as phase one for the sumo deadlift. For front squats, you'll start light and increase the weight on all three sets. When you can do the top end of the rep range on all three sets, increase the weight for each set come next workout. \r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\nSet 1: 135 pounds x 8 reps\r\nSet 2: 165 pounds x 8 reps\r\nSet 3: 195 pounds x 8 reps\r\nNext workout:\r\n\r\nSet 1: 140 pounds x 6 reps\r\nSet 2: 170 pounds x 6 reps\r\nSet 3: 200 pounds x 6 reps\r\n(Then you would stay at that weight until you get eight reps on all three sets). \r\n\r\nMay your legs grow as big as tree trunks and may your speed get as fast as the Flash!"

    "title": "The Greek God Missing Link: Neck and Traps",
    "content": "If you want to look like a Greek God, there’s one more thing we need to do. You can build an amazing physique, complete with an incredible upper chest, developed shoulders and muscular legs. That said, that doesn’t absolutely guarantee that you'll look your absolute best. \r\n\r\nIn many cases, there can be something missing. I’ve noticed this myself. I’ve seen really muscular guys and thought something was off...\r\n\r\nSometimes it’s because their upper chest or shoulders are lacking. But sometimes they have amazing shoulder and upper chest development and yet something is still missing.\r\n\r\nSomething is making them look less powerful and less masculine and less alpha. What is it? When you look at someone, you’re looking at the total package...and after a while, you'll notice two areas that can make them appear far more powerful and masculine:\r\n\r\nEnter Neck and Traps Training\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can have all the muscle in the world, but if your neck and traps are lacking, it’s going to throw off your whole physique. You’re going to look noticeably smaller. What’s more, if you gain muscle, but your neck and traps stay roughly the same size, it’s going to make you look smaller. \r\n\r\nYour neck can actually be a force multiplier. If you add a little size to your neck -- so that it’s thicker -- your face looks more masculine and attractive. Your overall physique looks bigger and more powerful. It makes a huge difference. \r\n\r\nYou can have a muscular upper body, but if you're wearing a shirt or jacket, a skinny neck can make you look so much smaller. \r\n\r\nFor instance, here’s Jeff Nippard, a fitness YouTube celebrity. He used to have a slim neck. Notice how he looks so much better with a thick neck. In fact, the skinny neck had a negative effect on his physique and even his facial attractiveness. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat About the Traps? \r\nThe same holds true with trap development. If your traps are too small, it’s going to throw things off. You'll look smaller and less jacked. There will also be something missing between your body and your face. \r\n\r\nFor example, this guy has a very muscular physique, but he has a relatively small neck and minimal trap development. It naturally makes him look less powerful and dominant. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf he were to wear a button down shirt, his small neck and traps would make him seem much less jacked and powerful. Many people may not even be able to tell he works out! That's why training your neck and traps specifically is so crucial; it gives you the size in underdeveloped areas to complete your Greek God physique.\r\n\r\nThe Key to Neck and Traps Training\r\nNow of course, you can overdevelop your neck and traps. And that’s also far from ideal. The key is balance. The key is to add the perfect amount of size to your neck and traps without going overboard.\r\n\r\nA lot of Hollywood movie stars that play superheroes naturally have the perfect neck and trap size. In fact, Chris Hemsworth is a great example of this and that’s why he looks so damn good on screen. \r\n\r\nThankfully, the neck and traps have a large degree of androgen receptors. This means that people that naturally have higher testosterone levels will naturally have a bigger neck and traps. This is an indicator that well-developed neck and traps portray a more powerful and masculine image. \r\n\r\nHere’s Brad Pitt in Fight Club. Notice how he has a well-developed neck? Plus, you can see how his traps pop nicely and make him look bigger overall. Brad Pitt was only about 155-160 pounds in \"Fight Club.\" And yet, he looks much thicker than that. That's the power of the neck and traps, my friend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to Supercharge Your Physique with Neck and Traps \r\nNow make no mistake, it’s not hard at all to add the perfect size to your neck and traps. In fact, we actually need to be careful not to overdo it. \r\n\r\nSome movements in the original program will actually strengthen and develop your neck and traps. For example, overhead presses and pullups will build your traps to a decent level. Lateral raises have been shown to activate the neck to a fairly large degree. So all we're doing is throwing in a little more direct work to the neck and traps to add icing to the cake. \r\n\r\nI recommend performing this routine once per week at the end of one of your workouts. For example, every Friday at the end of your workout would be an ideal place to add this.\r\n\r\nThe Greek God Neck and Traps Routine (Once Per Week)\r\nLeaning One-Arm Dumbbell Shrugs: 4 sets x 10-15 reps (Kino rep training) \r\nReverse Neck Curls: 3 sets x 20-30 reps (Kino rep training)\r\nNeck Curls: 3 sets x 20-30 reps (Kino rep training) \r\nWorkout Notes \r\nThe workout begins with leaning one-arm dumbbell shrugs. Alternatively, you can do cable shrugs. The key, of course, is to not just lift your shoulder straight up. Instead, lift your shoulder up and towards your ear. This puts the focus on your traps, maximizing activation.\r\n\r\nI recommend starting with a lighter weight and performing your first set for 15 reps. Rest one to two minutes and increase the weight to perform another set for 15 reps. Rest and increase the weight to perform your third set for 15 reps. Finally, rest and perform your fourth set with a very challenging weight that you can perform for 10-15 reps. At this point, your traps should be activated like crazy.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\nSet 1: 60 pounds x 15 reps\r\nSet 2: 70 pounds x 15 reps\r\nSet 3: 80 pounds x 15 reps\r\nSet 4: 90 pounds x 10 reps\r\nNext, we get into reverse neck curls. I recommend lying on a bench, face down, with your head off of the bench. Start with a light weight. A 5- or 10-pound plate is perfect. With the weight on the back of your head, perform reverse neck curls for 20-30 reps (raising your neck against gravity and the weight, keeping everything but the neck immobilized). Rest a couple minutes, increase the weight by 5-10 pounds and perform 20-30. Do this one more time for three sets.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\nSet 1: 10 pounds for 20 reps\r\nSet 2: 15 pounds for 20 reps\r\nSet 3: 20 pounds for 20 reps\r\nFinally, we have neck curls. This is performed by lying on your back on a bench, with your head off of the bench. Hold a light plate on your forehead and perform neck curls. Start light for 20-30 reps, increase the weight and perform 20-30 reps. Do this once more for three sets.\r\n\r\nI recommend not pushing too close to failure or your neck can cramp up. Don’t overdo it. Make sure to control the weight. When you can do the top end of the rep range (30 reps) for your last set, increase the weight next week. \r\n\r\nLast Thing...  \r\nThis routine is simple but effective (like any and all of my workouts). The cool thing is you'll notice results in the first few weeks of performing this routine. It really is that effective. Just a little extra direct neck and traps work will make all the difference in the world. \r\n\r\nYou'll start to get more compliments on your physique. In fact, when your neck and traps are thick, you'll look way more jacked and get way more attention. (Even more than someone that is actually bigger than you.)\r\n\r\nNow, if you start to get your neck and traps to a good level, you can train them once every two weeks. This is a good plan for maintenance mode, avoiding overtraining at the same time. Until then, you can train them once per week (every Friday or Monday). \r\n\r\nLooking forward to seeing your gains : )"
